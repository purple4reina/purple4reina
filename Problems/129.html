COMMENTS:

For a while I was choosing problems based on their difficulty percentage.  The
last few days I've been doing them based on the number of people who have
completed them.  Seems like that is a better predictor of the difficulty of a
problem for me.

I started with a basic, slow brute force implementation.  This allowed me to
print out values of A(n) that were the largest yet seen.  I noticed pretty
quickly that all these values of n were either divisible by 3 or prime.

From there it was just a matter of creating and testing the repunits.  The most
time consuming things for this were creating the repunits and doing the
division.  To speed things up, I applied the modulo as I went.  Runs in under a
second.


CODE:

def isprime(n):
    for p in range(7, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def solve(m):
    n = m - 1
    while True:
        n += 2
        if n % 5 == 0:
            n += 2
        if n % 3 == 0 or isprime(n):
            k = r = 1
            while r != 0:
                r = (r * 10 + 1) % n
                k += 1
            if k > m:
                return n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
