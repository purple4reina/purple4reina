COMMENTS:

Another repunits problem!  I chose it because I've already done I think two
other repunit related problems in the last couple of days so I figured I would
have some good context on it.

When prime p is not 2 or 5, there will always be a value i that divides
R(10**n).  In fact, if i divides R(10**n) then so does 2*i and 3*i, etc.  It is
possible to find the period by finding the first value of i that divides any
length repunit.  From there, if the value of this period is only divisible by 2
or 5, then we know that multiplying it enough times by a constant, we will
eventually reach a power of 10.


CODE:

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime or p < 2:
            continue
        num = p + p
        while num <= n:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

        if p == 2 or p == 5:
            total += p
            continue

        i = r = 1
        while r != 0:
            i += 1
            r = (r * 10 + 1) % p

        while i % 2 == 0:
            i //= 2
        while i % 5 == 0:
            i //= 5

        if i != 1:
            total += p

    return total


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
