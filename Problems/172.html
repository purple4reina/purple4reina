COMMENTS:

Got this one on the first try. That rocks. I used dictionaries to track the progress as 
new digits were added. If a digit had reach its limit, then that digit was not added on. 
It took almost 4 minutes to run, but that's alright by me!


CODE:

from itertools import *

numDict = dict(zip(product(range(4), repeat=10), [0]*4**10))
saved = numDict.copy()


numDict[(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)] = 1
numDict[(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)] = 1

i = 1
while i < 18:
	print i
	i += 1
	newDict = saved.copy()
	for key in numDict.iterkeys():
		for j in range(len(key)):
			if key[j] < 3 and numDict[key] > 0:
				newkey = list(key)
				newkey[j] += 1
				newkey = tuple(newkey)
				newDict[newkey] += numDict[key]
	numDict = newDict.copy()

total = 0
for value in numDict.itervalues():
	total += value

print total
