## Comments

I did a lot of research online before starting this problem. I knew there'd be
no other way to do it without that. I really didn't want to do it brute force
for sure.

Wikipedia lead me to some really old book that I had to dig through. It gave me
a really really nice formula for finding the number of distinct solutions to
this equation. The next problem was finding the correct answer. That part took
forever!

## Code

```python
from time import time
start = time()

def isprime(n):
	if n == 2:
		return True
	elif n < 2 or n%2 == 0:
		return False
	else:
		for i in range(3, int(n**0.5 + 1), 2):
			if n%i == 0: return False
		return True


primes = []
for n in xrange(10**6):
	if isprime(n) == True:
		primes.append(n)
primes = tuple(primes)

def nextprime_new(p):
	i = primes.index(p)
	return primes[i+1]

def nextprime(p):
	if p == 2:
		return 3
	else:
		while True:
			p += 2
			if isprime(p) == True:
				return p

def powerlist(n):
	ans = []
	p = 2
	while n > 1:
		i = 1
	 	while n%(p**i) == 0:
			i += 1
		if i > 1:
			n /= p**(i-1)
			ans.append(i-1)
		p = nextprime(p)
	return ans


n = 1
largest = 0
while True:
	n += 1
	alist = powerlist(n)
	ans = 1
	for a in alist:
		ans *= (1 + 2*a)
	ans = (ans + 1)/2

	if ans > 1000:
		print n, ans
		break
	elif ans > largest:
		largest = ans
	else:
		end, start = time() - start, time()
		print n, largest, end
```
