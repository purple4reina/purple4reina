## Comments

I think for this one I am going to head over to Python. I'm wanting something
that is scriptable. Though I'm sure Mathematica can handle what I'm looking
for, I'd rather have something that will run as a script that I can tweak with
each application.

The script I wrote is really inefficient. But I figure since it's my first
Python script, I'll let that slide.

## Code
