## Comments

I started out with this one thinking that I'd have to run through every single
10 digit number until I found all the primes. Then, run through all of those
primes untill I found the longest strings of digits, and yada yada. That would,
clearly, have taken years to complete.

Instead, I realized that about 9 ones and some other digit would probably be
prime.  And low and behold it was. That's where I started from: 9 of one digit,
and 1 of another. If that didn't work, I did 8 of one digit and 2 others. And
so on, until I got the answer.

## Code

```python
from itertools import *
def isprime(n):
	if n == 2:
		return True
	elif n < 2 or n%2 == 0:
		return False
	else:
		for i in range(3, int(n**0.5 + 1), 2):
			if n%i == 0: return False
		return True

primes = []
tested = set()

repitit = 10
intint = range(10)
works = []

while len(intint) > 0:
	repitit -= 1
	for w in works:
		try:
			intint.remove(w)
		except:
			pass
	for t in intint:
		print t
		for d in combinations_with_replacement(range(10), 10-repitit):
			for n in permutations([t]*repitit + list(d), 10):
				if n in tested: 
					continue
				number = int(''.join(map(str, n)))
				tested.add(n)
				if len(str(number)) < 10:
					continue
				if isprime(number) == True:
					primes.append(number)
					works.append(t)

print primes
print len(primes)
print sum(primes)
```
