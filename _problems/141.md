## Comments

This is officially the "hardest" problem I've completed!  The site claims that
it is difficultly level 60%.  Previously, the most difficult problems I was
able to complete were level 55%.  This really makes me feel like I can do
anything if I just put my mind to it.  I am so loving these problems.
:tada::purple_heart:

This problem just required a little bit of algebra and poking around.  A few
things stood out.  First, it is required that 0 < r < q < d < n.  It is also
possible that 0 < r < d < q < n, but I found that choosing either leads to the
same result.  From there it was just a matter of doing some algebra and
realizing that r must be a divisor of n**2.

## Code

```python
def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(n):
        if n in _cache:
            return _cache[n]
        ret = fn(n)
        _cache[n] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def divisors_factory(n):
    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = True
            num += p

    @memoize
    def _divisors(n):
        if n == 1:
            return []
        orig = n
        stop = n ** 0.5
        for p in primes:
            if p > stop:
                return [1]
            if n % p == 0:
                n //= p
                e = 1
                while n % p == 0:
                    n //= p
                    e += 1
                divs = _divisors(n)
                return [
                    d*p**exp
                        for exp in range(4*e+1)
                        for d in divs
                    if d*p**exp < orig
                ]
        return [1]

    return _divisors

def solve(n):
    third = 1 / 3
    total, m, num = 0, 1, 1
    divs = divisors_factory(n ** 0.5)
    while num < n:
        for r in divs(m):
            d3 = (num ** 2 // r) - 2 * num + r
            c = int(d3**third)
            if c**3 == d3 or (c + 1)**3 == d3:
                total += num
                break
        m += 1
        num = m ** 2
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10**1, 9),
        (10**2, 9),
        (10**3, 9),
        (10**4, 9),
        (10**5, 124657),
        (10**6, 700738),
        (10**7, 14253190),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
