## Comments

I tried to build in as many of the properties as possible as I was digging
through numbers. My for loops create squares of x-y and y-z. I then realized
that I could check x+y before entering the z loop. That sped things up quite a
bit.

## Code

```python
bound = 10**6

def issquare(n):
	if n**.5%1 == 0:
		return True
	else:
		return False

def squaretest(x,y,z):
	if issquare(x+y) == False:
		return False
	elif issquare(x+z) == False:
		return False
	elif issquare(y+z) == False:
		return False
	elif issquare(x-z) == False:
		return False
	elif issquare(x-y) == False:
		return False
	elif issquare(y-z) == False:
		return False
	else:
		return True

squares = []
for n in range(1, bound+1):
	if issquare(n) == True:
		squares.append(n)

for x in xrange(3, bound):
	if x%1000 == 0: print x
	for yi in squares:
		y = x - yi
		if y < 0:
			break
		elif issquare(x+y) == False:
			continue
		for zi in squares:
			z = y - zi
			if z < 0:
				break
			elif squaretest(x,y,z) == True:
				print x, y, z, x+y+z
				
```
