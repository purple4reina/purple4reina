## Comments

This problem is labeled with 65% difficulty rating.  This is now the "hardest"
problem I've solved!  Working on these more challenging problems gives me a lot
of confidence and joy.

I first implemented this using brute force.  Getting the horizontal rectangles
was easy.  The diagonals were certainly the hardest.  Figuring out the
algorithm was the toughest part.  It was one of those situations where it is
easy for a human to do it, but teaching a computer becomes very complex.  I
decided that the best way to structure the data was by rotating the grid 45
degrees.  I noticed that this always lead to a square with varying numbers of
missing squares in the corners.  Once I figured out the pattern to it, it was a
lot easier.  The tests passed soon thereafter.

From here it's a matter of speeding it up.  Ends up my brute force
implementation did get the correct answer in about 14-15 minutes.  But this
time I wanted to do it right and get it down to under a minute.  I did this (it
actually runs in about 70ms) by finding the patterns in the numbers of
diagonals found in each grid.  I threw some numbers into oeis and found
[https://oeis.org/A000447](https://oeis.org/A000447) and
[https://oeis.org/A330805](https://oeis.org/A330805) which fit the bill.  I
used these to replace my brute force algorithm for the diagonals.

## Code

```python
def horizontals(width, height):
    count = 0
    for w in range(1, width + 1):
        for h in range(1, height + 1):
            count += (height - h + 1) * (width - w + 1)
    return count

def adder(n):
    return n * (4 * n**2 - 1) // 3

def equals(n):
    return n * (n + 1) * (4 * n**2 + 12*n + 11) // 6

def diagonals(width, height):
    if width == height:
        return equals(width - 1)
    return diagonals(width - 1, height) + adder(height)

def solve(width, height):
    total = 0
    for w in range(1, width + 1):
        for h in range(1, height + 1):
            total += horizontals(w, h)
            if w < h:
                total += diagonals(h, w)
            else:
                total += diagonals(w, h)
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    m = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, m))
```
