## Comments

I made a function that spat back all the possible next digits when you feed it
two digits. I used a dictionary to keep track of the number of integers with
each last two digit string. It's really only those last two digits that you
care about, after that, it's just keeping track of how many numbers there are
with those last two digits.

## Results

Script runs in under 1 second!

## Code

```python
from itertools import *

def next_digit(a, b):
	largest = 9 - a - b
	return range(largest+1)


trys = dict()

for start in product(range(1,10), range(10)):
	if sum(list(start)) > 9:
		continue
	else:
		trys[start] = 1


for i in range(18):
	new_trys = dict()
	for t in trys.iterkeys():
		for n in next_digit(t[0], t[1]):
			try:
				new_trys[(t[1], n)] += trys[(t[0], t[1])]
			except:
				new_trys[(t[1], n)] = trys[(t[0], t[1])]
	trys = new_trys


total = 0
for s in trys.itervalues():
	total += s

print total
```
