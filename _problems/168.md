## Comments

I never did get working tests for this problem.  I got caught up in whether or
not to include numbers like 11111 in the sum.  Until the very end I excluded
them.  But after getting the wrong answer so many times, I attempted including
them to see what happened.  Yup, right answer.  I would have preferred to have
an example sum to work off of.

Reading through the threads after completing the problem, it looks like I
approached this in a very very different way from most people.  This problem
seems incredibly similar to [Problem 358](358) in that they both give the
number 142857 as an example of a cyclic number.  Therefore, I attempted to go
about this problem in a similar way.

I new that full cyclic numbers, like 142857, are the results of taking the
inverse of full reptend primes.  Since I was looking for kinda cyclic numbers,
I figured I could start by looking at inverses of numbers and their decimal
expansions.

I spent a long time trying to figure out the most efficient way to get the
repeating part of these repeating decimals.  I settled on using the
[multiplicative order](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MultiplicativeOrder.html)
which gave me the benefit of providing both the period and the repeating part
all in one algorithm.

The last step was to take multiples of these numbers and then check if their
right rotations fit the requirement.  Runs in about 13 seconds with Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def solve(digits):

    def periodof(k):
        r, n, p = 1, 0, 0
        while True:
            p += 1
            d, r = divmod(10 * r, k)
            n = n * 10 + d
            if r == 1:
                break
            if p >= digits:
                return 0, 0
        return p, n

    found = {}

    for n in range(7, 100000, 2):
        period, perdigits = periodof(n)
        if period < 6:
            continue
        tenminus = 10 ** (period - 1)
        tenperiod = tenminus * 10
        for k in range(1, n):
            num = k * perdigits
            if num > tenperiod:
                break
            div, mod = divmod(num, 10)
            rot = div + mod * tenminus
            if num == rot:
                break
            if num > tenminus and rot % num == 0:
                found[num] = True

    for d in range(1, 10):
        num = d
        for _ in range(digits - 1):
            num = 10 * num + d
            found[num] = True

    return sum(found) % 10**5

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
