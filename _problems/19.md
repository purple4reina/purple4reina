## Comments

This one was just annoying. I was putting it off for a while too. Again, the
biggest issue was reading the directions.

## Code

```python
def leap(y):
	if y in [1900, 2000]: return 'FALSE'
	elif y%4 == 0: return 'TRUE'
	else: return 'FALSE'
	
def monthlength(m, y):
	if m in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]: return 31
	elif m in [4, 6, 9, 11]: return 30
	elif m == 2:
		if leap(y) == 'TRUE': return 29
		else: return 28

dayofweek = 1
sum = 0
for y in range(1900, 2001):
	for m in range(1, 13):
		for d in range(1, monthlength(m, y)+1):
			print y, m, d, dayofweek
			if y >= 1901 and dayofweek == 0 and d == 1:
				sum = sum + 1
			if dayofweek == 6: dayofweek = 0
			else: dayofweek = dayofweek + 1

print sum
```
