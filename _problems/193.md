## Comments

I keep reading about the Möbius Function, but I'm not sure I've actually used
it in a problem before.

This was the third iteration of my code.  First I started with a very naive
approach, brute force, finding the prime factors of each number.  This allowed
me to get a set of tests in place for my next iteration.  In that I used a
sieve to find all the squareful numbers.  This was inefficient because whenever
a number had more than one prime factor with an exponent > 1, it was sieved out
once for each of these prime factors.

Instead, I needed to determine which of these squareful numbers would be
counted multiple times.  This is where the Möbius Function came in.  I found
this formula on [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Squarefree.html) and
wanted to try it out to see if it would be more efficient.  And it was!  I then
found a way to optimize the Möbius Function and was then able to get the
solution in about 28 seconds using Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(n):
        if n in _cache:
            return _cache[n]
        ret = fn(n)
        _cache[n] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def solve(n):
    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    @memoize
    def mobius(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        stop = n ** 0.5
        for p in primes:
            if n % p == 0:
                n //= p
                if n % p == 0:
                    return 0
                return -mobius(n)
            if p > stop:
                return -1

    count = 0
    for d in range(1, top + 1):
        count += mobius(d) * (n // d**2)
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

_test_solve = (
        (12, 8),
        (2**0, 1),

        (2**3, 6),
        (2**4, 11),
        (2**5, 20),
        (2**6, 39),
        (2**7, 78),
        (2**8, 157),
