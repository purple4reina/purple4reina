## Comments

This problem was pretty interesting and I especially loved that the solution
was so simple. There's a real beauty to something that can be solved in so few
lines of code. It really pleases me.

The solution relied just on a bit of algebra. Since we are looking for integer
solutions, we can replace $$2^t$$ with the variable $$r$$.

$$4^t=2^t+k$$

$$(2^2)^t=2^t+k$$

$$(2^t)^2=2^t+k$$

$$r^2=r+k$$

$$k=r^2-r=r(r-1)$$

Stepping through all integer values of $r$ will give us all possible solutions
for $k$. This is the denominator in our ratio.

To find the perfect solutions, we need to find solutions where $t$ is also an
integer. But since we already have integer solutions for $r=2^t$. Therefore,
$t$ will be an integer when $r$ is a power of $2$. This is the numerator in our
ratio.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):
    perfect, root, pow2 = 0, 1, 2
    while True:
        root += 1
        if root == pow2:
            perfect += 1
            pow2 <<= 1
        if perfect / (root - 1) < 1 / n:
            return root * (root - 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
