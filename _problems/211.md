## Comments

This problem felt pretty easy.  I already knew how to decently efficiently get
all the divisors of a number.  After that it was just a matter of squaring
those, adding them together, then determining if the result was a square.  This
solution isn't all that quick, runs in about a minute and a half.

## Code

```python
def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(n):
        if n in _cache:
            return _cache[n]
        ret = fn(n)
        _cache[n] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def divisors_factory(n):
    sieve = [True, True] + [False] * (n - 1)
    for p, iscomposite in enumerate(sieve):
        if iscomposite:
            continue
        sieve[p] = p
        num = p + p
        while num <= n:
            sieve[num] = p
            num += p

    @memoize
    def _divisors(n):
        if n == 1:
            return [1]
        p = sieve[n]
        n //= p
        e = 1
        while n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            e += 1
        divs = _divisors(n)
        return [d*p**exp for exp in range(0, 2*e+1, 2) for d in divs]

    return _divisors

def is_square(n):
    return int(n**0.5)**2 == n

def solve(n):
    divisors = divisors_factory(n)
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n):
        if is_square(sum(divisors(k))):
            total += k
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
