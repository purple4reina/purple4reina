## Comments

This problem finally taught me not to be afraid of modular arithmetic.  With
this I am now looking forward to other problems where I can dig in and finally
start to really grok modular arithmetic.  I already had a method saved for
finding an inverse for modular division.  What I needed in order to solve this
problem was an inverse for modular exponentiation.

I did a bit of googling and came across the
[Tonelli-Shanks
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm) for
finding the roots of $$r^2 \equiv n \pmod{p}$$.  The algorithm was pretty long
and definitely complex, not something I would have been able to deduce on my
own.  I did however need to learn about [quadratic
residues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue) in order to be able
to implement it correctly.  I feel okay about using an algorithm I found on
Wikipedia because firstly, never would have figured it out myself, and second,
since it's been named after a couple humans, I assume the idea is to share it
widely.

I also used a couple of lemmas from the webpage "[Prime sieving for the polynomial
$$f(n)=2n^2-1$$](http://devalco.de/quadr_Sieb_2x%5E2-1.php)."  These showed that
`If p | f(n) then also p | f(n+p)` and `If p | f(n) then also p | f(-n)`.  From
this knowledge and the algorithm above, I was able to create a sieve to find
the final answer.

I wish it ran a bit faster, but it completes in about 2 min 13 sec on Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def modinv(n, p):
    t, newt = 0, 1
    r, newr = p, n
    while newr:
        q = r // newr
        t, newt = newt, t - q * newt
        r, newr = newr, r - q * newr
    return t % p

def modroot(n, p):
    # find Q and S such that p - 1 = Q*2**S
    s = 0
    q = 1
    while p - 1 != q * (1 << s) or q % 2 == 0:
        s += 1
        q = (p - 1) // (1 << s)

    # find z a quadratic non-residue
    z = 2
    while pow(z, ((p - 1) // 2), p) != p - 1:
        z += 1

    # loop for the answers
    m = s % p
    c = pow(z, q, p)
    t = pow(n, q, p)
    r = pow(n, (q + 1) // 2, p)

    while t != 0 and t != 1:
        i = 1
        while pow(t, 1 << i, p) != 1 or m - i - 1 < 0:
            i += 1
            assert i < m, (i, m)
        b = pow(c, 1 << (m - i - 1), p)
        m = i
        c = pow(b, 2, p)
        t = (t * b ** 2) % p
        r = (r * b) % p

    return r, -r % p

        if m != 1 and m != 7:
            continue

        if not isprime(p):
            continue

        t1, t2 = solve_for_n(p)
        if t1 > n and t2 > n:
            break

        for t in (t1, t2):
            if t > n or t == 2:
                continue
            if 2 * t**2 - 1 == p:
                continue

            ts[t] = False

            num = p + t
            while num <= n:
                ts[num] = False
                num += p

            num = p - t
            if num < t:
                num += p
            while num <= n:
                ts[num] = False
                num += p

    return sum(ts)

    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
