## Comments

Very interesting problem.  It was a fun one to work on during this snowy day.

The trick was to figure out whether the digit was part of an A or a B.  Once we
have that information, it is simple to be able to find the digit.

I started by writing out the values of these "Fibonacci words" and noticed that
other than the first two letters, the remaining letters were always the same.
From here the trick was to figure out which row first houses the letter, then
modulo off the first half of the word until the location is either a 1 or a 2.

For example, if we are looking for the 18th letter in the Fibonacci word, we
notice that the first row that has more than 18 letters is the 8th row:

<pre class="highlight">
1:  A
2:  B
3:  AB
4:  BAB
5:  ABBAB
6:  BABABBAB
7:  ABBABBABABBAB
8:  BABABBABABBABBABA<strong><span class="s">B</span></strong>BAB
</pre>

Next, we chop off everything from the previous row (the 7th) leaving just
`BABABBAB`.  The highlighted letter is now the 5th letter in this Fibonacci
word.

<pre class="highlight">
1:  A
2:  B
3:  AB
4:  BAB
5:  ABBA<strong><span class="s">B</span></strong>
</pre>

Repeating the process one more time, we find that the highlighted letter is the
second letter of the third row.  We can now easily deduce that it is the letter
**B**.

## Code

```python
A = '1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679'
B = '8214808651328230664709384460955058223172535940812848111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196'

def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(n):
        if n in _cache:
            return _cache[n]
        ret = fn(n)
        _cache[n] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

@memoize
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    f1 = f2 = i = 1
    while i < n:
        i += 1
        f1, f2 = f2, f1 + f2
    return f2

def findletter(n):
    f, i = n, 0
    while f > 2:
        i = 0
        while fib(i) < f:
            i += 1
        f %= fib(i-1)
    if f == 1:
        if (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
            return 'B'
        return 'A'
    if (i + 1) % 2 == 1:
        return 'B'
    return 'A'

def solve(n):

    letters = {'A': A, 'B': B}
    lena = len(A)

    def d(n):
        d, m = divmod(n, lena)
        l = findletter(d+(m>0))
        return int(letters[l][(n-1)%lena])

    total, ten, seven = 0, 1, 1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        num = (127 + 19*i) * seven
        total += d(num) * ten
        ten *= 10
        seven *= 7
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

    problem.B = '8979323846'
    assert expect == solve(n)
