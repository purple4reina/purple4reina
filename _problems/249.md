## Comments

This problem was incredibly similar to [Problem 250](250) which I finished
yesterday evening.  I used most of the same code and the same approach here as
I did there.  I was unable to remove the inner most loop, however, which was
possible in Problem 250.  But it wasn't an issue here because of the much
smaller set size.

Now after reading through the forums, I feel like I could have done this a bit
more efficiently.  This solution takes about 3.5 minutes on Pypy3 and it seems
that others were able to get theirs to about 30 seconds.

## Code

```python
modulo = 10**16

def solve(n):

    top = (n + 2) * n // 2
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    superset = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        if p <= n:
            superset.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    superset_sum = sum(superset)
    searches = [[0] * superset_sum for _ in range(len(superset))]
    searches[0][0] = 1

    count = 0
    for index in range(len(superset)):

        if index == 0:
            search = searched = [1] + [0] * (superset_sum - 1)
        else:
            search = [0] * superset_sum
            start = superset[index-1]
            for i, d in enumerate(searched):
                key = i + start
                if key < superset_sum:
                    search[key] = (search[key] + d) % modulo
            searched = [searched[i] + search[i]
                    for i in range(superset_sum)]

        for total, repeat in enumerate(search):
            if not repeat:
                continue
            for i in range(index, len(superset)):
                new_total = total + superset[i]
                if sieve[new_total]:
                    count = (count + repeat) % modulo

    return count % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
