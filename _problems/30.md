## Comments

The bug I had to fix in this one was that I had the if statement in the wrong
place. It needed to be evaluated at the end of running through all digits in
the number, rather than after evaluating each digit. Noticing the difference it
makes to indent the if statement one level.

## Code

```python
import re
def num2str(n):
	return re.split('_', re.sub('\B', '_', str(n)))

sum = 0
for n in range(2, 10**6):
	power = 0
	for i in num2str(n):
		power = int(i)**5 + power
	if n == power: 
		sum = sum + n
		print n, sum
		
print '=', sum
```
