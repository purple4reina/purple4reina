## Comments

The key to this problem is in the modulo.  Ends up that the Fibonacci sequence
is cyclical for every modulo.  It's just a matter of finding what the period --
referred to as the Pisano period -- of this cycle is.  Without this, the values
of the Fibonacci numbers would be prohibitively high.

I was able to find the period by looking at the
[OEIS](https://oeis.org/A001175) page for the Pisano periods.  It included
several methods on how to find this number.  I ended up using a small python
algorithm shared there.  I decided not to include this in my final code since
it is much more code to find the number than it is to just figure it out once
and save it to a variable.

My program is much slower than I would like it to be.  Most of the time is
taken up in just finding and saving all the Fibonacci numbers.  When not saved
to a list, this process seems to be much faster.  I was unable to find
something that worked any faster.  However, there are a couple of things that I
believe will speed this up.  First, only find the Fibonacci numbers that are
required instead of the full 900,788,112 of them to complete the cycle.
Second, I am reading and learning of a way to extend the sieve of Eratosthenes
past the first $$\sqrt{n}$$ numbers.  I believe I can find the first group of
primes as I have here, then use those to sieve for another set of them
$$>10^{14}$$.

## Code

```python
modulo = 1234567891011

def solve(n):

    top = int(2 * 10**7)
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p * p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    period = 900788112
    a = i = 0
    b = 1
    fibs = []
    while i < period:
        fibs.append(a)
        a, b, i = b, (b + a) % modulo, i + 1

    def next_prime(n):
        k = n - (n % 2 == 0)
        while True:
            k += 2
            stop = int(k ** 0.5)
            for p in primes:
                if p > stop:
                    return k
                if k % p == 0:
                    break
            else:
                raise AssertionError('not enough primes')

    total, p = 0, 10**14
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        p = next_prime(p)
        total += fibs[p % period]
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
