## Comments

It was really fun how this problem reduced down to just being a problem based
on Euler's Totient.  Once that was figured out, I was able to put together a
solution pretty quickly.

## Code

```python
def cache(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(n):
        if n in _cache:
            return _cache[n]
        ret = fn(n)
        _cache[n] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def solve(n):

    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [True] * (top + 1)
    primes = []
    for p, is_prime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not is_prime or p < 2:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    @cache
    def totient(k):
        if k == 1:
            return 1
        top = k ** 0.5
        for p in primes:
            if p > top:
                break
            if k % p == 0:
                k //= p
                e = 1
                while k % p == 0:
                    k //= p
                    e += 1
                return p ** e * (1 - 1/p) * totient(k)
        return k - 1

    visible = 0
    for r in range(1, n + 1):
        visible += totient(r)

    orchard = n * (n + 1) // 2
    return 6 * int(orchard - visible)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python

from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (0, 0),
        (1, 0),
        (2, 6),
        (3, 12),
        (4, 24),
        (5, 30),
        (6, 54),
        (7, 60),
        (8, 84),
        (9, 102),
        (10, 138),
        (11, 144),
        (12, 192),
        (13, 198),
        (14, 246),
        (15, 288),
        (16, 336),
        (17, 342),
        (18, 414),
        (19, 420),
        (20, 492),
        (100, 12036),
        (1000, 1177848),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
