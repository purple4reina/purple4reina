## Comments

This problem was different from most problems because there were no real great
ways to write tests.  I was never quite certain that the code I was writing
would eventually get me to the answer.  I did start out by writing a few tests,
but they quickly became useless.

There were a few things that I figured out about cyclic numbers.  After that,
it just took me several days to figure out in which order to check each of them
by until I found the answer.

Firstly, I discovered that if you multiply a cyclical number by one more than
its length, you get a string of all 9s.  Next, all cyclic numbers are just 1/p
where p is a prime number called a full reptend prime.  Finally, those primes
all follow the pattern of 10^k != 1 mod p, for k < p - 1.  And furthermore,
when k = p - 1, then 10^k must equal 1 mod p.  I also found a quick little
algorithm to checking both if p is a full reptend prime and also return the
cyclic number associated with it!  It was then a matter of figuring out in
which order to apply all this knowledge.

## Code

```python
ten_5 = 10**5
ten_11 = 10**11

def the_far_right(p):
    t, r, n = 0, 1, 0
    summ = 0
    while True:
        t += 1
        d, r = divmod(10 * r, p)
        n = (10 * n + d) % ten_5
        summ += d
        if r == 1:
            break
    if t == p - 1:
        return n, summ
    return 0, 0

def primes():
    p = ten_11 // 138 - 10
    while True:
        top = int(pow(p, 0.5))
        for n in range(3, top + 1):
            if p % n == 0:
                break
        else:
            yield p
        p += 2

def solve(left, right):
    for p in primes():
        ratio = ten_11 // p
        if ratio > left:
            continue
        elif ratio < left:
            raise AssertionError('should have found it by now!')

        if (right * p) % ten_5 == 99999:
            found_right, digit_sum = the_far_right(p)
            if found_right == right:
                return digit_sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    left = eval(sys.argv[1])
    right = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(left, right))
```
