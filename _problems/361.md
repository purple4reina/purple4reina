## Try One

### Comments

This is a great problem! It is really all about finding patterns. I've got an
initial code prepared. But I realize now that it would take years and years and
years to complete the process. The issue is finding all the elements of An. If
I go through all the integers one by one as this code does, it will take
forever. I now realize I must go about it differently. I'll change the code so
that instead of finding the integers themselves within the 0's and 1's, I'll
use the 0's and 1's themselves to derive each of the integers that are found.
This should be a much faster process. At least I hope!

### Code

```python
from time import time
start_time= time()
print """Process started
----------"""


#Step 1: Create {Tn}

t = [0]
for n in range(100000000):
	print n
	t[2*n:] = [t[n]]
	t[(2*n + 1):] = [1 - t[n]]
t = ''.join(map(str, t))
print t


#Step 2: Create {An}

a = []
j = 0
while len(a) < (10**18 +1):
	print j
	i = bin(j).lstrip('0b')
	if t.find(i) != -1:
		a.append(j)
	j = j+1
print a


#Step 3: Do the sigma

sigma = 0
for k in range(1, 19):
	sigma = sigma + a[10**k]
	
print sigma
		

end_time= time()
elapse_time= end_time - start_time
print '----------'
print elapse_time, 'seconds have passed'
```

## Try Two

### Comments

This was a valient effort. I think I'm getting closer. I'm starting to learn
the details of this sequence. Next step I think is to create a derivation
formula that makes all the elements of An.

### Code

```python
from time import time
start_time= time()
print """Process started
----------"""


#Step 1: Create {Tn}

t = [0]
for n in range(10**6):
	print n
	t[2*n:] = [t[n]]
	t[(2*n + 1):] = [1 - t[n]]
t = ''.join(map(str, t))


#Step 2: Create {An}

a = [0]
for l in range(1, 10**4):
	if len(a) > (10**5):
		break
	for i in range(1, len(t) - l):
		itest = int(str(t[i:(i+l)]), 2)
		print l, i, len(a)
		if (a.count(itest) == 0):
			a.append(itest)
		elif a.count(itest) > 0:
			break


a = sorted(a)
print len(a)


#Step 3: Do the sigma

#sigma = 0
#for k in range(1, 19):
#	sigma = sigma + a[10**k]
	
#print sigma
		

end_time= time()
elapse_time= end_time - start_time
print '----------'
print elapse_time, 'seconds have passed'
```
