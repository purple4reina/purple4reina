## Comments

This problem just required a little bit of algebra and modular division.  I had
to look up and learn a bit about modular division first though.  It doesn't
work for every divisor and modulus, but if the modulus is prime, then it will
always work.  Funny that!  In which case `a/b % p` becomes `a * pow(b, p-2, p)`.

## Code

```python
from sympy import sieve

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    for p in sieve.primerange(5, n):
        total += ((p//2) * pow(p-4, p-2, p) + p//2) % p
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(solve(10**8))
```
