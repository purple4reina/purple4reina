## Code

```python
def str2num(n):
	return int(''.join(map(str, n)))

from itertools import permutations
thelist = []

for first in permutations(range(10), 4):
	firstpiece = first
	firstnumber = str2num(first)
	if firstnumber%2 == 0:
		thelist.append(firstpiece)

primes = [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
for p in primes:
	newlist = thelist
	thelist = []
	for new in newlist:
	#	second = str(second)
		#print new
		for i in range(10):
			#i = str(i)
			if i not in new:
				newpiece = list(new); newpiece.append(i)
				#print newpiece
				newnumber = str2num(newpiece[-3:])
				if newnumber%p == 0:
					thelist.append((newpiece))

final = map(str2num, thelist)
print final
print sum(final)
