## Comments

I looked up the easy ways to see if a number is divisible by 11.

>    Form the alternating sum of the digits. The result must be divisible by 11.

Using combinatorics, I just needed to find the number of ways that 20 choose 10
could result in 2 groups of numbers that could be divisible by 11.  There were
only 16,000 and some of them, so that felt really doable.  From there, it's
just a matter of finding the number of permutations of these groups that could
result in a 20 digit number.  Basically, it just couldn't start with a 0 and we
must account for the fact that there's 2 of each number by dividing the result
by 2**10.

## Code

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    all_digits = tuple(range(10)) + tuple(range(10))
    elevens = 0
    for combo in combinations(all_digits, 10):
        if (2 * sum(combo) - 90) % 11 == 0:
            elevens += sum(1 for i in combo if i != 0)
    nine_fact = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2
    return elevens * 10 * nine_fact ** 2 // (1 << 10)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(solve())
```
