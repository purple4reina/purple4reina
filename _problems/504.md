## Comments

It's unfortunate to have 4 nested for loops.  I'm sure I could have been a bit
smarter in piecing together all of the possible triangles.  But since this only
needs to run through 10**8 possibilities, I figure this was okay.  The thing
that sped it up to a manageable speed was caching the values of `num_below`.
Once I did that, the program was able to run in about 35 sec with pypy3.

## Code

```python
_num_below = {}
def num_below(a, b):
    key = (a, b)
    if key in _num_below:
        return _num_below[key]

    total = 0
    for i in range(a):
        div, mod = divmod(b * (a - i), a)
        total += div
        if mod == 0:
            total -= 1

    _num_below[key] = total
    return total

def solve(n):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, n + 1):
            for c in range(1, n + 1):
                for d in range(1, n + 1):
                    total = 1 + num_below(a, b) + num_below(b, c) + \
                            num_below(c, d) + num_below(d, a)
                    if int(total ** 0.5) ** 2 == total:
                        count += 1
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (1, 1),
        (2, 5),
        (3, 13),
        (4, 42),
        (5, 88),
        (6, 156),
        (7, 220),
        (8, 376),
        (9, 566),
        (10, 862),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
