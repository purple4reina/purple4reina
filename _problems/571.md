## Comments

I enjoy problems like this one that are easy enough to grasp what needs to be
done on the first read, but are still challenging enough to require a good bit
of thought.  I guess when I look for which problem I'm going to work on next, I
look for ones that I can immediately have an idea of how to solve, at least by
brute force.  This was definitely one of those problems.

My first shot, brute force attempt just looked through all numbers starting
with 1 and checked to see if it was $n$-super-pandigital.  From here I realized
that I need at least $n$ base-$n$ digits if the number is going to be
$n$-pandigital.

From here I soon realized that I was going to have to be much more efficient in
my search.  Since we know what all the base-$n$ pandigital numbers are going to
look like, I wrote an iterator that yields all these pandigital numbers.  From
here it was straightforward.  One small optimization to check for
super-pandigital-ness starting with with the largest base and working back
toward 2 was needed.  Then I was able to get the answer.

Runs in 1 minute 52 seconds with Pypy3.

## Code

```python
import itertools

def is_pandigital(n, b):
    digits = {}
    while n:
        n, d = divmod(n, b)
        digits[d] = True
        if len(digits) == b:
            return True
    return False

def is_super_pandigital(n, k):
    for b in range(k, 1, -1):
        if not is_pandigital(n, b):
            return False
    return True

def solve(b, c=10):
    total = count = 0
    powers = tuple(b**i for i in range(b)[::-1])
    for digits in itertools.permutations(range(b)):
        if digits[0] == 0:
            continue
        n = sum(d*p for d, p in zip(digits, powers))
        if is_super_pandigital(n, b - 1):
            total += n
            count += 1
            if count == c:
                break
    else:
        raise AssertionError('not enough super-pandigitals found')
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    c = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, c))
```
