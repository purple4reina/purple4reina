## Comments

I finished this problem over a month ago and never did my write up about it.
I'd planned on doing a long discussion and go really deep into the math on it.
But clearly that is too much for me to do right now.

I chose this problem because of the probability course I'm taking this term. I
figured doing a couple problems based on probability would help me understand
the material better. I enjoyed the chance to apply what I was learning. I would
like to continue working on probability based problems.

I actually just turned in the final for my probability course and am feeling
good about it. It was nice having a distraction from the difficult situation
with the pandemic. Plus, I feel like the things I learned will be directly
applicable to my job.

## Code

```python
modulo = 10**8

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def reduce(a, b):
    g = gcd(a, b)
    return a//g, b//g

def p(n, k):
    two_n_one = pow(2, n, modulo) - 1
    two_n_k = pow(2, n - k, modulo)
    return reduce(two_n_k*(k-1)*two_n_one + n*two_n_k, two_n_one**2)

def m(n, k):
    num, den = p(n, k)
    return num * den

def solve(n, k):
    return m(n, k) % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    k = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, k))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve, p, m

_test_p = (
        ((3, 1), (12, 49)),
        ((6, 2), (368, 1323)),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_p)
def test_p(n, expect):
    assert expect == p(*n)

_test_m = (
        ((3, 1), 588),
        ((6, 2), 486864),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_m)
def test_m(n, expect):
    assert expect == m(*n)

_test_solve = (
        ((10, 4), 24818624),
        ((99, 23), 80660992),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(*n)
```
