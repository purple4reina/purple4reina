## Comments

This one frustrated me. I had problems dealing with how to arrange all the data
that I needed to keep track of throughout the process. I tried ordered pairs,
then a dictionary, then back to ordered pairs. It was tough trying to make sure
that I got all the indexes correct for all the lists.

## Code

```python
def P(k, n):
	if k == 3:
		return n*(n+1)/2
	if k == 4:
		return n**2
	if k == 5:
		return n*(3*n-1)/2
	if k == 6:
		return n*(2*n-1)
	if k == 7:
		return n*(5*n-3)/2
	if k == 8:
		return n*(3*n-2)

def end(n):
	n = str(n)
	return n[2] + n[3]

def begin(n):
	n = str(n)
	return n[0] + n[1]

k = 3; n = 1; num = []
while k <= 8:
	while len(str(P(k, n))) <=4:
		if len(str(P(k, n))) == 4:
			num.append([P(k, n), k])
		n += 1
	k += 1; n = 1

circles = []
for a in num:
	for b in num:
		if end(a[0]) == begin(b[0]):
			for c in num:
				if end(b[0]) == begin(c[0]):
					for d in num:
						if end(c[0]) == begin(d[0]):
							for e in num:
								if end(d[0]) == begin(e[0]):
									for f in num:
										if end(e[0]) == begin(f[0]) and end(f[0]) == begin(a[0]):
											circles.append([a, b, c, d, e, f])


for q in circles:
	poly_list = []
	for poly in q:
		poly = poly[1]
		if poly not in poly_list:
			poly_list.append(poly)
	if len(poly_list) == 6:
		total = 0
		for number in q:
			total += number[0]
		print total
```
