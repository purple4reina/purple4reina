## Comments

This problem was a fun one and it wasn't too hard so I enjoyed it. It
definitely didn't keep me up all night so that was a plus! I ultimately solved
it in three stages.

Stage one: brute force. First I created a func that given a deck size, would
return the number of shuffles required to put it back to its original state. I
was able to figure out the algorithm for this by doing a little trial and error
on paper. Ends up it has to do with powers of 2 and modulo math. I let this run
overnight (might as well right?) and found it continuing to chug away in the
morning. Doing a bit of math, I found out that I was needing to get through
each number up to 2 to the power of 60! Wow, that's a big number and definitely
not one you can brute force your way to. So I tried something else.

Stage two: reversing modulo. I had figured out that the algorithm had to do
with modulus math. Instead of brute forcing, I needed to find a way to devise
the answers. This meant reversing the modulo function. In other words, given
`a mod b = c` we know that the answers are going to be in the form
`a = n*b + c` where n is an integer. This solves for a, but I wanted to solve
for b which ends up being `b = (a - c) / n`. I used this formua for a while and
still found it to be incredibly slow.

Stage three: divisors of `(a - c)`. I looked closer and realized that if n does
not divide `(a - c)` evenly, then there is no point in trying it. Therefore, I
tried creating a slice of all integers that divide `(a - c)` evenly and only
trying those. I was worried that creating this divisor slice would take an
insane amount of time. But it didn't! And eventually I was lead to the answer
in just 19 seconds of program time. Pretty awesome!

Was this my first problem solved in Golang? Maybe! Funtimes!

## Code

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// nextLocation gives the next location of a given card location.
func nextLocation(currentLocation, deckSize int) int {
	return (currentLocation * 2) % (deckSize - 1)
}

var (
	overageErr = fmt.Errorf("passed goal shuffle count")
	oddErr     = fmt.Errorf("deck size should not be odd")
)

// shufflesNeeded returns the total shuffles need to return a deck of size
// deckSize back to its original configuration.
func shufflesNeeded(deckSize, goal int) (int, error) {
	if deckSize%2 != 0 {
		return 0, oddErr
	}
	currentLocation := 1
	shuffles := 0
	for {
		shuffles++
		currentLocation = nextLocation(currentLocation, deckSize)
		if currentLocation == 1 {
			return shuffles, nil
		}
		if currentLocation == deckSize-2 {
			return shuffles * 2, nil
		}
		if shuffles > goal {
			return 0, overageErr
		}
	}
}

// getDivisors returns a slice of the divisors of num.
func getDivisors(num int) []int {
	halfWay := int(math.Sqrt(float64(num))) + 1
	d := []int{1, num}
	for i := 2; i < halfWay; i++ {
		if num%i == 0 {
			d = append(d, i)
			if div := num / i; div != i {
				d = append(d, div)
			}
		}
	}
	return d
}

// sumShufflesNeeded returns the total of all deck sizes that are possible to
// shuffler perfectly in goal times.
func sumShufflesNeeded(goal int) int {
	max := int(math.Pow(2, float64(goal))) - 1
	var totalDeckSizes int
	for _, n := range getDivisors(max) {
		i := (max / n) + 1
		if shuffles, _ := shufflesNeeded(i, goal); shuffles == goal {
			totalDeckSizes += i
		}
	}
	return totalDeckSizes
}

func main() {
	result := sumShufflesNeeded(60)
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```
