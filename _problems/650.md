## Comments

So, I don't know what it is, but this problem was listed as 5% easiest as well
and I still had to let it run for several hours just to get to the answer.
That feels really frustrating to me.

I did enjoy working on this problem though.  The math for it got simpler and
simpler as I worked through it and simplified and simplified it down.  It
actually ended up being a pretty small and tight problem, which was really
cool.  Runtime still got slower and slower as it went, but not exponentially
so, but still not ideal.  I did some micro speed improvements, like adding a
cache for the powers, but those will not improve upon the eternal slowing of
the running, only just starts the race a bit faster.

## Code

```python
MODULO = 1000000007
_exponents_cache = {}

def solve(max):
    total, factors, fact_sub = 1, {}, {}
    for i in range(2, max + 1):
        for k, v in fact_sub.items():
            factors[k] -= v
        for k, v in prime_factors(i).items():
            factors[k] = factors.get(k, 0) + (v * (i - 1))
            fact_sub[k] = fact_sub.get(k, 0) + v

        row_total = 1
        for cache_key in factors.items():
            cache = _exponents_cache.get(cache_key)
            if cache:
                prime_total = cache
            else:
                prime, exponents = cache_key
                numerator = pow(prime, exponents + 1) - 1
                denominator = prime - 1
                prime_total = (numerator // denominator) % MODULO
                _exponents_cache[cache_key] = prime_total
            row_total *= prime_total

        total += row_total

    return total % MODULO

_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]

def primes_iterator():
    for p in _primes:
        yield p

    while True:
        p += 2
        for n in range(3, int(p ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if p % n == 0:
                break
        else:
            _primes.append(p)
            yield p

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    for prime in primes_iterator():
        exponent = 0
        while n % prime == 0:
            n //= prime
            exponent += 1
        if exponent > 0:
            factors[prime] = exponent
        if n == 1:
            return factors

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    max = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(max))
```
