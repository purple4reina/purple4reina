## Comments

This problem was a nice departure from the more math and algebra heavy problems
I've been working on recently.  For this one I managed to get the problem
working for small numbers then printed out a list of all answers for H(n) for n
from 1 to 1000.  The more I stared at the numbers, the more patterns I began to
see.  After studying them for a few days I was able to get a formula for how to
derive G(n) when n is a fibonacci number.

## Code

```ruby
def solve(max)
  f1, f2 = 3, 2
  g1, g2 = 6, 3

  loop do
    g1, g2 = g1 + g2 + f1, g1
    f1, f2 = f1 + f2, f1
    return g1 if f1 == max
  end
end

puts solve(23416728348467685)
```

## Tests

```ruby
require 'test/unit'
require './problem'

class TestProblem < Test::Unit::TestCase
  [
    [5, 12],
    [8, 23],
    [13, 43],
    [21, 79],
    [34, 143],
    [55, 256],
    [89, 454],
    [144, 799],
  ].each do |heap, expect|
    define_method "test_solve_#{heap.to_s.rjust(3, '0')}" do
      assert_equal expect, solve(heap)
    end
  end
end
```
