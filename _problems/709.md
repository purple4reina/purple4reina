## Comments

I started by creating a brute force problem along with tests.  Of course this
was going to be too slow.  I tried a couple of things to try to speed it up,
but all were too minute.  I then started to look for patterns in the output.
I printed the number possibilities for the number of bags in the cupboard after
each one is added.  There were a couple of patterns I noticed, but the most
important is that the odd numbered rows start with a value that is the sum of
the previous row.  Since I was looking for the sum of a row, this was the
solution I was looking for.  It is important that the number of bags he puts
into the closet is even.

I then went to search OEIS for this sequence and learned about Euler Numbers.
There's lots of sequences based off them.  I grabbed a generating function from
there and got the answer in under 4 seconds.

I do feel strange that I grabbed some code off OEIS for this.  Does that count
as me solving the problem?  Do I get points for searching and coming across the
right number sequence?  I think in the future I will try to understand the
problem a bit better and be able to come up with my own generating function.

## Code

```python
modulo = 1020202009


def solve(n):
    num = 0
    A = {-1: 0, 0: 1}
    k = 0
    e = 1
    for i in range(0, n+1):
        Am = 0
        A[k + e] = 0
        e = -e
        for j in range(0, i+1):
            Am += A[k]
            A[k] = Am % modulo
            k += e
        if e < 0:
            num = A[-i//2]
    return num % modulo


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
