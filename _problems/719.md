## Comments

As professed, this one was pretty easy.  Though I had to let it run for around
an hour, I was still able to finish it up in a single day.  I implemented what
I thought was a pretty slow solution then grabbed the full list of S numbers
using that.  When I put that sequence into OEIS I found
https://oeis.org/A038206.  From there I learned that the square number must be
0 or 1 mod 9.  That lead me to the solution.

## Code

```python
def T(n):
    total, r, s = 0, 4, 16
    while s <= n:
        r += 1
        s, mod = r ** 2, r % 9
        if mod != 0 and mod != 1:
            continue

        str_s = str(s)
        for c in range(1, 1 << len(str_s) - 1):
            splits = ((c >> i) & 1 for i in range(len(str_s)-1))

            i = summ = 0
            for j, split in enumerate(splits):
                if not split:
                    continue
                summ += int(str_s[i:j+1])
                if summ > r:
                    break
                i = j+1
            else:
                summ += int(str_s[i:])
                if summ == r:
                    total += s
                    break

    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    p = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(T(10 ** p))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import T

_test_T = (
    (10 ** 1, 0),
    (10 ** 2, 181),
    (10 ** 3, 181),
    (10 ** 4, 41333),
    (10 ** 5, 184767),
    (10 ** 6, 10804656),
    (10 ** 7, 30940313),
    (10 ** 8, 2818842841),
    (10 ** 9, 6222187932),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_T)
def test_T(n, expect):
    assert expect == T(n)
```
