## Comments

For this problem I decided on an implementation and instead of turning back
when things got hard, I kept going at it until I was able to implement it.  I
knew that in theory my algorithm would work efficiently, it was just a matter
of figuring out how to implement it.

My first implementation was brute force, running through all numbers and
figuring out the maximum square that divides it.  From there I wrote some tests
then implemented a sieving algorithm that sieved for primes, then marked all
multiples of its square using a second sieve.  These were both incredibly
inefficient because they meant looping approximately $$n$$ times.

Instead of finding the maximal square for each number, I instead set out to
find the count of numbers whose maximal square was $$d^2$$.  This method meant
that I only needed to loop approximately $$\sqrt{n}$$ times.

It was easy to find a count of integers with $$d^2$$ as a divisor.  However, it
was much harder to find a count where $$d^2$$ was the _maximal_ square divisor.
To do this, I found the easy count of $$d^2$$ divisors, then went about
subtracting the numbers that had $$d^2$$ as a divisor, but it wasn't the
largest square divisor.  And since some numbers would get removed twice (like
144 for instance), those needed to be added _back_.  And then there's ones that
got removed and then added back twice (like 3600 for instance), those needed to
be _removed_.  This lead to the recursive solution below.

The last step was to add a 1 for all the squarefree numbers which I did by
maintaining a count.  Runs in about 5 seconds on Pypy3.

## Code

```python
modulo = 1000000007

def solve(n):

    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    def doubles(p, psq, sign=1):
        count = 0
        for q in primes:
            if q == p:
                continue
            if q > p:
                break
            pqsq = psq * q**2
            if pqsq > n:
                break
            count += sign * (n // pqsq)
            count += doubles(q, pqsq, -sign)
        return count

    total = count = 0
    for d in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        d_count = 0

        dsq = d ** 2
        d_count += n // dsq
        for p in primes:
            dpsq = dsq * p**2
            if dpsq > n:
                break
            d_count -= n // dpsq
            d_count += doubles(p, dpsq)

        total += d_count * dsq
        count += d_count

    return (total + n - count) % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
