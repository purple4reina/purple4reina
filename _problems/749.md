## Comments

Searching through all numbers below $$10^{16}$$ to see if they are near power
sums is unreasonable.  Instead, I searched through all permutations of 16
digits 0 - 9.  This was much more manageable at just over 2 million
permutations.  For each of these, I raised the digits to _k_ powers and then
checked to see if this value was a permutation of the original permutation.

The toughest part of this was dealing with answers and sums that end in either
0 or 9.  For these, there was more than one digit that was different between
the two numbers.  I tried several algorithms for this and ultimately settled on
what you see below.

It's pretty slow, most of the time is taken up in the `digits` method.  Runs in
just under 50 seconds on Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):

    def permutations(n):
        arr = [0] * n

        def _perm(depth=0):
            if depth == n:
                if any(d > 1 for d in arr):
                    yield arr
                return
            start = arr[depth-1] if depth else 0
            for i in range(start, 10):
                arr[depth] = i
                yield from _perm(depth+1)

        yield from _perm()

    def digits(summ):
        digs = []
        while summ:
            summ, d = divmod(summ, 10)
            digs.append(d)
        return digs + [0] * (n - len(digs))

    def nearpower(arr, summ):
        sorted_arr = tuple(sorted(arr))
        # summ + 1
        sum_digs = digits(summ + 1)
        if tuple(sorted(sum_digs)) == sorted_arr:
            return summ + 1

        # summ - 1
        sum_digs = digits(summ - 1)
        if tuple(sorted(sum_digs)) == sorted_arr:
            return summ - 1

        return 0

    top = 10 ** n
    total = 0

    for p in permutations(n):
        k = 1
        while True:
            summ = sum(d**k for d in p)
            if summ > top:
                break
            num = nearpower(p, summ)
            if num:
                total += num
                break
            k += 1

    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (2, 110),
        (3, 110),
        (4, 110),
        (5, 110),
        (6, 2562701),
        (7, 2562701),
        (8, 381784152),
        (9, 1144909106),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
