## Comments

This problem was pretty straight forward.  I started by creating the function
that concatenates the numbers by the given formula.  I tested this against the
example given in the problem.  From there I tested out a couple more numbers,
one large and one small. I wanted to see if the function was strictly
increasing, meaning that when he input gets larger, so does the output.  This
was indeed the case, which meant I could use a binary search to find the
ultimate solution.

Only challenge here was in comparing numbers at such high precision after the
decimal point.  I used the python decimal package for this.  Though often slow,
the decimal package worked in this case because it only took 80 iterations to
find the solution.  Runs in about 180 milliseconds.

## Code

```python
import decimal as d

rnd = 24
d.getcontext().prec = rnd + 4

def concat(theta):
    numstr, b1 = '', theta
    while len(numstr) < rnd + 3:
        b2 = int(b1) * (b1 - int(b1) + 1)
        numstr += str(int(b1))
        b1 = b2
    return numstr[:1] + '.' + numstr[1:rnd+1]

def solve():
    mins, maxs, two = d.Decimal(2), d.Decimal(3), d.Decimal(2)
    while True:
        theta = (mins + maxs) / two
        thetas = str(theta)[:rnd+2]
        tau = concat(theta)
        if tau == thetas:
            return tau
        elif tau > thetas:
            mins = theta
        else:
            maxs = theta


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(solve())
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import concat

_test_concat = (
        (2.0,               '2.222222222222222222222222'),
        (2.956938891377988, '2.358132134558914423337759'),
        (2.99,              '2.359151928424242424242446'),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_concat)
def test_concat(n, expect):
    assert expect == concat(n)
```
