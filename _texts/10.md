## Try One

### Comments

Ahhh! Another primes problem! I'm starting with the code I used in Problem 7.

### Resources

After completing Problem 7, I read through some of the forum posts on the
problem. I learned two ways to cut the computation time down. First, test only
odd numbers. Second, test if each number is prime using all previous primes up
to the sqrt of the number.

### Results

After running for over 46 minutes, this script resulted in the wrong answer.
When taking the sqrt, it allowed perfect squares to slip through into the
primes pile.

### Code

```
set primes_sum to 0
set primes_list to {2}
set primes_list_ref to a reference to primes_list
set t to (time of (current date))

log "starting step 1"
repeat with this_num from 2 to 1000000
	set this_num to (this_num * 2 - 1)
	copy is_this_prime(this_num, primes_list_ref) to this_eval
	if this_eval is not {} then
		copy this_eval to the end of primes_list_ref
	end if
end repeat

to is_this_prime(a_num, primes_list)
	set prime_limit to ((the last item of primes_list) ^ 0.5)
	repeat with a_prime in primes_list
		if a_prime > prime_limit then exit repeat
		if (a_num / a_prime mod 1 is 0) then return {}
	end repeat
	return a_num
end is_this_prime

log "starting step 2"
repeat with n in primes_list
	set primes_sum to (primes_sum + n)
end repeat


log ((time of (current date)) - t)
return primes_sum
```

## Try two

### Comments

With this next try, I took the idea of taking out all the evens to the next
level. I took out all of the multiples of 2, 3, 5, 7 from even needing to be
tested. With a dry run, this change yielded a list of all primes under 10,000
in 2 seconds!

There is definitely a pattern emerging here. I'm contemplating how to integrate
this elimination of the small primes into the code, but on a much larger scale.
And in a way that generates itself.

### Results

I'm still not getting the right answer with this. I'm not sure where to go next
so I'm going to move on to the next problem for the time being and come back to
this one later with a fresh mind.

### Code

```
set primes_list to {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
set the_pattern to {13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997, 1009, 1013, 1019, 1021, 1031, 1033, 1039, 1049, 1061, 1063, 1069, 1087, 1091, 1093, 1097, 1103, 1109, 1117, 1123, 1129, 1151, 1153, 1163, 1171, 1181, 1187, 1193, 1201, 1213, 1217, 1223, 1229, 1231, 1237, 1249, 1259, 1277, 1279, 1283, 1289, 1291, 1297, 1301, 1303, 1307, 1319, 1321, 1327, 1361, 1367, 1373, 1381, 1399, 1409, 1423, 1427, 1429, 1433, 1439, 1447, 1451, 1453, 1459, 1481, 1483, 1487, 1489, 1493, 1499, 1511, 1523, 1531, 1543, 1549, 1553, 1559, 1567, 1571, 1579, 1583, 1597, 1601, 1607, 1609, 1613, 1619, 1621, 1627, 1637, 1657, 1663, 1667, 1669, 1693, 1697, 1699, 1709, 1721, 1723, 1733, 1741, 1747, 1753, 1759, 1777, 1783, 1787, 1789, 1801, 1811, 1823, 1831, 1847, 1861, 1867, 1871, 1873, 1877, 1879, 1889, 1901, 1907, 1913, 1931, 1933, 1949, 1951, 1973, 1979, 1987, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2011, 2017, 2027, 2029, 2039, 2053, 2063, 2069, 2081, 2083, 2087, 2089, 2099, 2111, 2113, 2129, 2131, 2137, 2141, 2143, 2153, 2161, 2179, 2203, 2207, 2213, 2221, 2237, 2239, 2243, 2251, 2267, 2269, 2273, 2281, 2287, 2293, 2297, 2309}

## Try Three

### Comments

Now I'm trying Python. So much better! I've got some learning to do with this
language, but it sure does the trick!


### Code

```python
g = []
for n in range(2, 20, 2):
	for x in range(2, int(n**.5 + 1)):
		if n % x == 0:
			break
	else:
		g.append(n)
print g
sum = sum(g)
print sum
```
