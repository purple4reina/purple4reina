## Comments

This was definitely a challenging problem. At first I had no idea what it was
asking me for. But after reading some on Wikipedia about networks and graph
theory, it made more sense.

## Resources

I used the Prim's algorithm entry on Wikipedia to help me implement an
effective algorithm.

## Code

```python
f = open('network.txt', 'r')
network = []
old_total = 0
for r in f:
	r = r[:-2].split(',')
	for i in range(len(r)):
		if r[i] == '-':
			r[i] = 10**3
		else:
			r[i] = int(r[i])
			old_total += r[i]/2.0
	network.append(r)

nodes_used = [0]
total = 0

while sorted(nodes_used) != range(40):
	next = min(min(network[i]) for i in nodes_used)
	
	for i in nodes_used:
		if next in network[i]:
			index = [i,network[i].index(next)]
	if index[1] not in nodes_used:
		total += next
		nodes_used.append(index[1])
	
	network[index[0]][index[1]] = 10**3

print int(old_total - total)
```
