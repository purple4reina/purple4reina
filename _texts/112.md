COMMENTS:

This one was easy! It was refreshing to have a problem that I got on the 
first try. The last handful that I've done were all very very challenging.

For this one, I defined a function that would tell me if a number is 
bouncy or not. It did so by turning the number into a string, then going 
through the number digit by digit. Because it didn't have to evaluate the 
entire number, and instead returned True at the first instance of both 
increase and decrease, the function ran very fast.


CODE:

def bouncy(x):
	x = str(x)
	up = False
	down = False
	for i in range(1, len(x)):
		if x[i] > x[i-1]:
			up = True
		elif x[i] < x[i-1]:
			down = True
		if up == True and down == True:
			return True
	return False

bouncies = float(0)
n = 1

while (bouncies * 100 / float(n)) != 99:
	n += 1
	if bouncy(n) == True:
		bouncies += 1


print n, (bouncies * 100 / float(n))
