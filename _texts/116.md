I like problems like this. I like them because the math behind them isn't
initially clear and I get to think creatively about the solution.

## Code

```python
bound = 50
count = 0

redDict = dict()
greenDict = dict()
blueDict = dict()

red = 2
green = 3
blue = 4

for k in xrange(bound+1):
	redDict[k] = 0
	greenDict[k] = 0
	blueDict[k] = 0

#red
for length in range(red, bound+1):
	for start in range(1, length-red+2):
		redDict[length] += 1
		redDict[length] += redDict[length-start-red+1]

#green
for length in range(green, bound+1):
	for start in range(1, length-green+2):
		greenDict[length] += 1
		greenDict[length] += greenDict[length-start-green+1]

#red
for length in range(blue, bound+1):
	for start in range(1, length-blue+2):
		blueDict[length] += 1
		blueDict[length] += blueDict[length-start-blue+1]


count = redDict[bound] + greenDict[bound] + blueDict[bound]
print count
```
