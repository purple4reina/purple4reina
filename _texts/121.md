## Comments

I first tried to not use any brains and just play the game a million times and
see if the bank lost. That didn't work out because it was really really slow,
and didn't always come up with the correct value.

Instead, I did the math. There were two steps to it. The first and toughest
part was getting the probability of winning. This depended on there being a
greater number of blues pulled than reds. So, I needed to find the product of
1's and some numbers, where those numbers were based on the exact turn from
which the blue was pulled. That took a little work to get it to come out right.

The easier part was figuring out if the bank won. I wrote out the simple
algorithm for this. I had the payout variable increase until the bank lost.

Below I've included both of the tries I made, the latter being the one that
worked.

## Try One

### Code

```python
from random import choice

turns = 15
bound = 10**6

payout = 2000
while True:
	payout += 1
	wins = 0
	money = 0
	for i in range(bound):
		bag = ['r', 'b']
		money += 1
		blues = 0
		for j in range(turns):
			take = choice(bag)
			bag.append('r')
			if take == 'b':
				blues += 1
		if blues > turns/2.0:
			money -= payout
			wins += 1
	print payout, money, wins
```

## Try Two

### Code

```python
from operator import mul
from math import factorial
from itertools import product

turns = 15

work = range(1,turns+1)
prob = 0

for mult in product([0,1], repeat=turns):
	if sum(mult) >= turns/2.0:
		continue
	next = 1
	for i in map(mul, mult, work):
		if i == 0:
			continue
		else:
			next *= i
	prob += next

payout = 0
while True:
	payout += 1
	if (factorial(turns+1)-prob) - prob*(payout-1) < 0:
		print payout - 1
		break
```
