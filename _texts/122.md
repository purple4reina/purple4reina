## Comments

I initially got the wrong answer for this problem.  That doesn't happen all too
often for me, so it was definitely a new and interesting challenge!  What I was
doing wrong initially was that I was attepting to memoize my `_m` closure.
This wouldn't work since a later search with the same inputs could yield a
smaller result.  It's not guaranteed that each input has a single value for its
output.  I was able to uncover my mistake by writing tests for ever number
between 1 and 200 that pass when memoized.  I then ran the tests again without
memoization (very slowly) and saw some fail.  This is how I knew I was wrong.
Instead, the solution still searches everything in a depth first manner,
however, it stops and returns early if the answer would be larger than one
already found.  That saved enough time for the program to run in a reasonable
amount of time: 45 seconds with Pypy3.

The search algorithm I used is one very similar to the ones I've written when
doing integer partitions.

## Code

```python
def m(n):
    arr = [1] + [0] * (n - 1)
    minimal = [float('inf')]

    def _m(last, index):
        if index == minimal[0]:
            return
        elif last == n:
            minimal[0] = index
            return
        index += 1
        for val in arr[:index]:
            this = last + val
            if this > n:
                return
            arr[index] = this
            _m(this, index)

    _m(1, 0)
    return minimal[0]

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        total += m(k)
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
