I used wikipedia to find the formula for a pyramidal number. This is the same
thing as finding the sum of squares of integers from 1 to n.

## Comments

Finding that formula on wikipedia is what made this problem so easy and run so
fast. Instead of having to test every single number below 10^8, I was able to
quickly produce all the values. Then I tested that they were palindromic.

## Code

```python
def pal(n):
	n = str(n)
	for i in range(int(len(n)/2)):
		if n[i] != n[-1-i]:
			return False
	return True

def pyr(n):
	return (2*n**3 + 3*n**2 + n)/6

used = set()
bound = 10**8
bigger = 1
total = 0

while bigger <= bound**.5:
	bigger += 1
	if bigger%100 == 0: print bigger
	for smaller in range(bigger-1):
		this = pyr(bigger)-pyr(smaller)
		if this < bound and pal(pyr(bigger)-pyr(smaller)) == True and this not in used:
			total += this
			used.add(this)

print total
```
