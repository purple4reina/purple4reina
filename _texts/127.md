## Comments

It's kinda cool looking and seeing that some of the problems in this range
(like 125) I completed exactly 9 years ago today!  It's kinda fun looking back
and seeing what I was up to back then.  I'm super glad that I started this
little website back when I did.  I've been really really loving doing these
problems over the years.

The key to getting this problem is realizing that since a, b, and c are
coprime, then rad(a*b*c) = rad(a)*rad(b)*rad(c).  The slowest piece of this
problem is getting the greatest common denominator.  It was just by chance that
I figured out that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, a + b) = 1 and gcd(b, a + b) =
1.  After I did it, I took a second to think about why this is true and it
makes sense.  After getting those two key pieces of knowledge, all I had to do
was use a sieve to collect all the rads.

Runs in about 8 seconds on Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while a:
        b, a = a, b % a
    return b

def solve(n):
    sieve = [1] * (n + 1)
    for p, val in enumerate(sieve):
        if val > 1 or p < 2:
            continue
        num = p
        while num <= n:
            sieve[num] *= p
            num += p

    total = 0
    for b in range(2, n):
        for a in range(1, b):
            c = a + b
            if c >= n:
                break
            if sieve[b] * sieve[a] * sieve[c] < c:
                if gcd(a, b) == 1:
                    total += c
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (1000, 12523),
        (2500, 57799),
        (3000, 62972),
        (3500, 85147),
        (4000, 108127),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
