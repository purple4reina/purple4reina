COMMENTS:

This problem just required a bit of algebra.  My strategy was to just go
through all possible values of i, j, k for which i**2 - j**2 - k**2 was greater
than zero and less than a million.  The first thing I did was remove k from
that equation because we know that k = 2*j - i.  The next thing was to figure
out the upper bound for j.  We know that my value for the variable `key` needs
to be greater than zero.  From there it is easy to solve for j in terms of i.
Next I checked the output of i and j to see when the values were in the correct
range.  That allowed me to set an upper bound for i, and know that at a certain
point, we can break out of j.  So, in the end I was able to find the lower and
upper bounds for both i and j, with the addition of breaking out early from j
when k falls too low.  Runs in under a second.


CODE:

def solve(n, m):
    solutions = {}
    for i in range(3, 5*m//4+1):
        for j in range(4*i//5, i//2, -1):
            key = 4*i*j - 5*j**2
            if key >= m:
                break
            solutions[key] = solutions.get(key, 0) + 1
    count = 0
    for val in solutions.values():
        count += val == n
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    m = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, m))
