## Comments

I've started including tests for any wrong answers that I get as well.  It's
more complete and also allows me to keep track and check against my mistakes.

This problem was just a brute force solution.  No fancy equations here, though
that would have been really really nice.

I think if I had to do this again, I wouldn't use recursion.  I'd just make a
big old nested for loop.  I checked the forums and there was at least one
person who did it that way.  I think I like to shy away from that method
because it's much much harder to write tests for.  What I really needed here to
get this down to a more reasonable amount of time was to have access to my
`reference` variable that I made up in the `check` method down in the `search`
method.  This way I could have restricted the range of numbers that would be
used when calling the recursive search.  This would have meant I'd not be
wasting as much time with grids that could never have produced a viable
solution.

Runs in just over 6 minutes with Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):

    nsqr = n ** 2
    nsqrn = nsqr - n
    grid = [0] * nsqr

    def check(index):
        if index < n - 1:
            return True
        g = grid[:index+1]

        # reference sum
        reference = sum(g[:n])

        # row
        if (index + 1) % n == 0:
            seqsum = sum(g[index-n+1:index+1])
            if seqsum > reference:
                return None
            if seqsum < reference:
                return False

        # column and diagonal comparison
        if index == nsqrn - n + 1:
            if sum(g[:nsqrn-n+1:n]) != sum(g[n-1:nsqrn+1:n-1]):
                return False

        # first diagonal
        if index == nsqrn and index > 1:
            seqsum = sum(g[n-1:nsqrn+1:n-1])
            if seqsum > reference:
                return None
            if seqsum < reference:
                return False

        # column
        if index >= nsqrn:
            seqsum = sum(g[index%n:index+1:n])
            if seqsum > reference:
                return None
            if seqsum < reference:
                return False

        # last diagonal
        if index == nsqr - 1:
            seqsum = sum(g[::n+1])
            if seqsum > reference:
                return None
            if seqsum < reference:
                return False

        return True

    def search(index):
        count = 0
        end = 5 if index == 1 else 10
        for n in range(end):
            grid[index] = n
            result = check(index)
            if index == nsqr - 1 and result:
                return 1
            elif result:
                count += search(index + 1)
            elif result is None:
                return count
        if index == 1:
            count *= 2
        return count

    return search(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
