COMMENTS:

A very interestng problem!  It was cool that there were almost two problems in
one here.  The first was how to determine if a fraction is terminating or
non-terminating.  It ends up that as long as the denominator is coprime to all
primes _except_ for 2 and 5, then the fraction is terminating.  Second, it ends
up that finding large powers of large numbers is hard.  Who knew.  Eventually
for Pypy3 when we get to n=1930 calculating P overflows.  The solution for that
was to take the logorithm of P.  This is allowed because we do not need the
actual value of P, we just need to be able to compare it to other P's.
Therefore, as long as the function we apply to P is continuously increasing,
the values for P will maintain their size comparison.

Code runs in about 300 milliseconds.


CODE:

import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(5, n + 1):
        top_p = top_j = 0
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            split = j * math.log10(k / j)
            if split > top_p:
                top_p = split
                top_j = j
            else:
                break

        top_j //= gcd(k, top_j)
        while top_j % 2 == 0:
            top_j //= 2
        while top_j % 5 == 0:
            top_j //= 5

        if top_j == 1:
            total -= k
        else:
            total += k

    return total

    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
