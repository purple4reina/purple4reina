## Comments

I'm not very good with probability. I've never taken a stats class. So, before
going into this one, I wanted to make sure I really understood what I was
looking for.

I did a bunch of reading on Wikipedia and Wolfram MathWorld about probability
and realized I needed the Total Probability Theorem. P(B) = P(B|A1)P(A1) + ...
+ P(B|An)P(An) where A1, A2, ..., An are mutually exclusive. I chose Colin's
rolls of each given number sum as the A's and the probability of Peter beating
him as the B's.

## Results

With this knowledge, the script ran correctly the first time!

## Code

```python
from itertools import *

PeterDict = dict(zip(range(37), [0]*37))
ColinDict = dict(zip(range(37), [0]*37))
for game in product(range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5), range(1,5)):
	PeterDict[sum(game)] += 1

for game in product(range(1,7), range(1,7), range(1,7), range(1,7), range(1,7), range(1,7)):
	ColinDict[sum(game)] += 1

PeterSum = 0
ColinSum = 0

for Ps in PeterDict.itervalues():
	PeterSum += Ps
for Cs in ColinDict.itervalues():
	ColinSum += Cs

P = 0
for Colin in ColinDict.iterkeys():
	PeterWins = 0
	ColinProb = (ColinDict[Colin]/float(ColinSum))
	for Peter in PeterDict.iterkeys():
		if Peter > Colin:
			PeterWins += PeterDict[Peter]
	P += ColinProb * (PeterWins/float(PeterSum))

print P
```
