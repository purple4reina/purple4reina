## Comments

I'm sure there's got to be a way to either reduce this big sum or actually
calculate the answer in some way.  But I don't know how to do it.  So, I used
binary search instead.  Requires the decimal modulo because the numbers are too
precise for floating point arithmetic.  Runs in about 9 seconds on Pypy3.

## Update

After reading through the forum posts once I finished the problem, I realized
that I can vastly improve the performance of this code.  The slowest part is
taking the large powers of `r**(k-1)`.  This can be avoided by storing the
r-power in a variable, and just multiplying this by `r` for each loop.  Takes
the time down to about 700 ms.

```python
r_k = 1
for k in range(1, n + 1):
    total += (900 - 3*k) * r_k
    r_k *= r
```

## Code

```python
import decimal
decimal.getcontext().prec = 15

def s(n, r):
    if r == 0:
        return n
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        total += (900 - 3*k) * r**(k-1)
    return total

def solve(n, a):
    top, bottom = 10, -10
    last = 0
    while True:
        r = decimal.Decimal((top + bottom) / 2)
        num = s(n, r)
        if num == last:
            return round(r, 12)
        if num > a:
            bottom = r
        else:
            top = r
        last = num

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    m = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, m))
```
