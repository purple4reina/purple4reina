## Comments

It took me a surprisingly long time to realize that the millionth item in a
list using Python is referenced with the number 999999, not 1000000 or 1000001.
Other than that, Python is great because it already has a permutations function
built in! Shortest script ever!

## Code

```python
def onenumber(n):
	return ''.join(map(str, n))


from itertools import permutations
all = map(onenumber, permutations(range(10)))

print all[999999]
```
