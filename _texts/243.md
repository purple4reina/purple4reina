## Comments

I've been working on this problem off and on for a really long time.  It was
the last problem I needed in order to get the "Trinary Triumph" award.  I
remember the last time I worked on it having a tough time.  But when I pulled
it out today, I was able to finish it in under an hour.  I guess I am learning
things from doing all these problems....

It was pretty easy to see right away that we were looking for the ratio between
Euler's totient and one minus the number.  I grabbed my already made totient
function and was able to get a working program pretty quickly.  Only problem
was, you guessed it, it was too slow.  Printing out the values of d that
produced a newly small ratio, I was able to see that the difference between
numbers was very consistent.  This lead me to an answer.  Program runs in about
0.1 seconds.

## Code

```python
def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(*args):
        if args in _cache:
            return _cache[args]
        ret = fn(*args)
        _cache[args] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def is_prime(p):
    for n in range(3, int(p**0.5) + 2, 2):
        if p % n == 0:
            return False
    return True

_primes = [2, 3]
def primes():
    for p in _primes:
        yield p
    while True:
        p += 2
        if is_prime(p):
            _primes.append(p)
            yield p

@memoize
def totient(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    top = n ** 0.5
    for p in primes():
        if p > top:
            break
        if n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            e = 1
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
                e += 1
            return p ** e * (1 - 1/p) * totient(n)
    return n - 1

def solve(n):
    d, prevd, ratio, minn, diff = 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
    while ratio >= n:
        d += diff
        ratio = totient(d) / (d - 1)
        if ratio < minn:
            diff = d - prevd
            minn = ratio
            prevd = d
    return d

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (4/10, 12),
        (0.17102402829451352, 38798760),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
