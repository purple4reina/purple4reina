It's fun when they're easy :)

## Code

```python
from time import time
start_time= time()
print """Process started
----------"""


f = []
f[0:] = [1]
f[1:] = [1]

for g in range(2, 10000):
	f[g:] = [f[g-1] + f[g-2]]
	if f[g] > (10**999):
		print (g+1)
		break; break
		

end_time= time()
elapse_time= end_time - start_time
print '----------'
print elapse_time, 'seconds have passed'
```
