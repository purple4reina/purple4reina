## Comments

I got a bit confused about how many times I needed to raise 2 to a power.
Shifting left this many, then right this many, it got a bit out of control.

As always, I started with a na√Øve approach that checks each possibility and
each sub-sequence.  Then I realized that the number of sub-sequences is n, the
values for each sub-sequence item is between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and therefore
each value must be present exactly one time.  This allowed me to create a
recursive approach (I really do love recursion) that ensures that the only
duplicates created are just twists in the ring.

Program runs in under 200 milliseconds.

## Code

```python
def concat(seq):
    num = 0
    for s in seq:
        num <<= 1
        num += s & 1
    return num

def solve(n):

    def minimal_orien(num):
        num = bin(num)[2:].rjust(1 << n, '0')
        minim = num
        for i in range(len(num)):
            seg = num[i:] + num[:i]
            minim = min(seg, minim)
        return int(minim, base=2)

    seq = [0] * (1 << n)

    def rings(i):
        i -= 1
        if i == 0:
            yield concat(seq)
            return
        last = seq[i]
        for k in range(2):
            num = (last >> 1) + (k << (n - 1))
            if num in seq[i:] or num == last:
                continue
            seq[i-1] = num
            yield from rings(i)

    total, founds = 0, {}
    for ring in rings(1 << n):
        minim = minimal_orien(ring)
        if minim not in founds:
            total += minim
        founds[minim] = True
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (3, 52),
        (4, 51504),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
