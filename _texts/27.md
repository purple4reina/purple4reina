## Comments

It's need that in a list of lists, the max() operator can still work. It pulls
the item with the largest value of it's first object. This problem was pretty
fun and just because there were so many little steps in it. This is also the
first problem that used negative numbers. 

## Code

```python
def isprime(n):
	for i in range(2, int(n**0.5 + 1)):
		if n%i == 0: return 'FALSE'
	return 'TRUE'

from itertools import count
def longest(a, b):
	for n in count(0):
		quadratic = n**2 + a*n + b 
		if quadratic < 0: return 0
		elif isprime(quadratic) == 'FALSE': return n
		
this = []
for a in range(-1000, 1000):
	for b in range(-1000, 1000):
		print a, b
		this.append([longest(a, b), a*b])
	
print max(this)
```
