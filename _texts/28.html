COMMENTS:

This one was fun and easy. I found a simple pattern in the numbers that are generated with this method. There was really no need 
to create the whole square.

I've now progressed to Level 1! I'm very excited! I'm currently one of just 35721 people to make it this far. There's a long road 
ahead, but I'm still super excited about it.


CODE:


bound = 1001

diagonals = [1]
for r in range(1, ((bound-1)/2)+1):
	adder =  2 * r
	for c in range(1, 5):
		next = max(diagonals) + adder
		diagonals.append(next)
		if next == (bound**2): break; break
		
print sum(diagonals)
