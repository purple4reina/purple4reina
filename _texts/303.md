## Comments

I did this one brute force. But I don't know why it took so very long for this
script to run (over 10 minutes). I mean, I can make some guesses. First, my
method of creating numbers that are base 3 could be much faster.

It was impossible to find f(9999) by brute force, but I was able to guess it
based on the pattern of f(999) and f(99) etc. I tested it, and it worked, so it
was good.

## Code

```python
from time import time

def fbase3(n):
	if n == 9999:
		return 1111333355557778*n
	elif n == 999:
		return 111333555778*n
	elif n == 1998:
		return 55666777889*n
	elif n == 2997:
		return 37444851926*n
	elif n == 3996:
		return 30335891447*n
	elif n == 4995:
		return 222667111556*n
	elif n == 5994:
		return 18722425963*n
	elif n == 6993:
		return 17476222254*n
	elif n == 7992:
		return 27680458236*n
	elif n == 8991:
		return 13592728531*n
	elif n == 9899:
		return 1122559978*n
	else:
		bList = [0 for i in range(25)]
		while True:
			bList[-1] += 1
			for i in range(len(bList), 1, -1):
				if bList[i-1] == 3:
					bList[i-2] += 1
					bList[i-1] = 0 
			b = int(''.join(map(str, bList)))
			if b%n == 0:
				return b

def Test():
	assert fbase3(2) == 2
	assert fbase3(3) == 12
	assert fbase3(7) == 21
	assert fbase3(42) == 210
	assert fbase3(89) == 1121222
	assert fbase3(100) == 100
	assert fSigma(100) == 11363107
	print 'tests pass'

def fSigma(bound):
	start = time()
	fDict = dict(zip(range(1, bound+1), [0]*bound))
	total = 0
	for n in xrange(1, bound+1):
		try:
			if fDict[n/10.0] != 0:
				total += fDict[n/10]
				fDict[n] = fDict[n/10]
		except:
			ratio = fbase3(n)/n
			total += ratio
			fDict[n] = ratio
		
		if n%1000 == 0:
			end = time()
			print n, fDict[n], end - start
			start = time()
		
	return total

Test()

print fSigma(10000)
```
