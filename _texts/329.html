COMMENTS:

First problem of the year!  So happy to have made it safely through 2020 and
into a new year.  These problems have really been a wonderful distraction from
the stress the coronavirus pandemic has brought to my life.  Just about every
evening I'll snuggle up in bed and grab a problem to work on.  Diving deep into
learning something new.  It's relaxing and I feel I've really learned a lot
from it this year.  I hope to continue working on them through 2021 and beyond.

As for this specific problem, the code could really use some DRY'ing up (don't
repeat yourself).  But it works.  I made one code decision that wasn't as
performant but really improved readability.  I added a `probability` class to
keep track of the number of found and total words.  I considered going one step
furture and implementing `__add__` so I could just `+=`.  I feel like that
would probably be a lot cleaner looking, but probably more confusing and more
error prone.

It's a bit slow and could probably stand for some optimization, but all in all,
it takes just under a minute to run.


CODE:

def memoize(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(*args):
        if args in _cache:
            return _cache[args]
        ret = fn(*args)
        _cache[args] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

class probability(object):
    def __init__(self, found=0, total=0):
        self.found = found
        self.total = total

    def add(self, other):
        self.found += other.found
        self.total += other.total

    def ratio(self):
        div = gcd(self.found, self.total)
        return self.found // div, self.total // div

def solve(n):

    top = 500
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    for p, is_prime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not is_prime:
            continue
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    search_word = 0b111100111011010 >> (15 - n)

    @memoize
    def search(location, jumps, word):
        if jumps == n:
            if word == search_word:
                return probability(1, 1)
            return probability(0, 1)
        jumps += 1
        prob = probability()
        word <<= 1
        if sieve[location]:
            if location != 1:
                prob.add(search(location - 1, jumps, word + 1))
                prob.add(search(location - 1, jumps, word + 1))
