## Comments

This problem was actually pretty simple and I was able to get it in just a
couple hours of work.  I was able to create all the repunits below 10**8 pretty
easily.  It would have worked fine but probably needed to run for about an hour
or more.  From looking at the output of this slower version, I noticed that all
the strong repunits were found very very early on, and all the last ones
searched were numbers that had only a single repunit representation.  I figured
if I exited early I'd be able to save a lot of time.  I implemented that
quickly, the tests passed, then I ran the program.  Runs in about a half second
on pypy3 and a second and a half on python3.

## Code

```python
def solve(top):
    repunits = {}
    for base in range(2, top):
        num = base + 1
        exp = 1
        while num < top:
            repunits[num] = repunits.get(num, 0) + 1
            exp += 1
            num += base ** exp
        if exp == 2:
            break

    return sum(k for k, v in repunits.items() if v > 1 or k > base+1) + 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10 ** 1, 8),
        (10 ** 2, 540),
        (10 ** 3, 15864),
        (10 ** 4, 450740),
        (10 ** 5, 12755696),
        (10 ** 6, 372810163),
        (10 ** 7, 11302817869),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
