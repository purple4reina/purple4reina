## Comments

The hardest part about this one for me was trying to figure out the string
slicing so I could create the palendromic numbers.  For the life of me I
couldn't figure out how to reverse a string, but omit the last character before
reversing.

After that the solution was pretty easy to get to.  At first I had this code
create the squares then look for the cubes.  But that was problematic because
floating point numbers don't work well when dividing by three.  So I switched
it to be create the cubes and look for the squares.  Answer in a little over 2
seconds using Pypy3.

## Code

```python
def palendromes():
    pow0, pow1 = 1, 10
    while True:
        for n in range(pow0, pow1):
            strn = str(n)
            yield int(strn + strn[-2::-1])
        for n in range(pow0, pow1):
            strn = str(n)
            yield int(strn + strn[::-1])
        pow0, pow1 = pow1, pow1 * 10

def is_square(n):
    return int(n ** 0.5) ** 2 == n

def solve(n):
    squ_cubes = []
    for p in palendromes():
        found = 0
        for cube in range(1, int(p ** (1/3)) + 1):
            remain = p - cube ** 3
            if is_square(remain):
                found += 1
                if found > 4:
                    break
        if found == 4:
            squ_cubes.append(p)
            if len(squ_cubes) == n:
                break
    return sum(squ_cubes)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
