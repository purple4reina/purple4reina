## Comments

I'd like to work out a faster way to do this problem. As it is, this is
spending more than half its time determining which numbers are prime. I am
assuming that it is double checking some of them.

Therefore, as it is, this script takes way too long to run. But, it works at
least.

## Code

```python
def generating(n):
	if (isprime(n + 1) == False) or (n ** 0.5 == 0):
		return False
	else:
		for d in xrange(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
			if (n % d == 0) and (isprime(d + (n / d)) == False):
				return False
		else:
			return True

def isprime(n):
	if n == 2:
		return True
	elif n < 2 or n%2 == 0:
		return False
	else:
		for i in xrange(3, int(n**0.5 + 1), 2):
			if n%i == 0: return False
		return True

def Test():
	assert generating(30) == True
	print 'tests pass'


def Main():
	Test()
	bound = 10**8
	total = 0
	for n in xrange(bound):
		if n%10**4 == 0: print n
		if generating(n) == True:
			total += n
	print total

Main()
```
