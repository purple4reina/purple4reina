## Comments

This problem was cute.  I knew the reference in the title about the infinite
hotel.  That didn't come into play a whole lot though.

This problem really benefitted from drawing it out on paper.  After doing so, I
was able to see that there was definitely a pattern involved.  I started
tackling the proble as I normally do, with a brute force solution.  This
allowed me to create a set of tests I could use as I continued to amend the
code.

The formulas I came up with are super cumbersome and long.  I am sure they can
be reduced (and probably combined into a single formula) but I was unsure of
how to do it given the floor divisions.  Ends up this implementation was speedy
enough.  If I were doing this as part of work or anything, I'd definitely look
into cleaning up those formulas!

Lastly, most of the code is for getting all the divisors of 71328803586048.  I
probably didn't need all of that, given I already knew it's prime
factorization.  However, it was essential if I was going to run tests with
varying input values.

## Code

```python
mult = 71328803586048  # 2**27 * 3**12
modulo = 10**8

def divisors(maxx):
    top = int(maxx ** 0.5)
    sieve = {}
    primes = []
    for p in range(2, top + 1):
        if sieve.get(p):
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = p
            num += p

    def _divisors(n):
        if n == 1:
            return [1]
        if n > top:
            stop = n ** 0.5
            for p in primes:
                if p > stop:
                    return [1, n]
                if n % p == 0:
                    break
            else:
                return [1, n]
        else:
            p = sieve.get(n)
            if not p:
                return [1, n]
        n //= p
        exp = 1
        while n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            exp += 1
        return [d*p**e for d in _divisors(n) for e in range(0, exp + 1)]

    return _divisors(maxx)

def p(f, r):
    if f == 1:
        return r * (r + 1) // 2
    n = f**2 // 2
    if f % 2 == 0:
        return n + (1 + (r-1)//2) * ((r-1)//2) + ((4*f + (r//2)*2) * (r//2))//2
    return n + ((r//2)*2*(r//2))//2 + (((r-1)//2) * (2*f + 2*((r-3)//2 + f)))//2

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    for d in divisors(n):
        total += p(d, n//d) % modulo
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
