## Comments

Dealing with turning numbers into their digits and if those digits have quotes
around them, and commas, and brackets, etc is really annoying. It takes so much
trial and error.

## Code

```python
def str2num(n):
	return ''.join(map(str, n))
	
import re
def num2str(n):
	return re.split('_', re.sub('\B', '_', str(n)))

decimal = []
for n in range(10**6):
	n = num2str(n)
	for i in n:
		decimal.append(i)

product = 1
for n in range(7):
	product = product * int(decimal[10**n])
	
print product
```
