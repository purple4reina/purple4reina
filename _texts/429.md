## Comments

This one felt relatively easy to me.  I needed to find the prime factorization
of `n!` and then find all divisors that "suck up" all of a single prime factor.
In other words, if the prime factorization includes 5^13 then the divisor must
either have all 5^13 or none 5^0.

Coming up with these divisors was relatively easy and just required a simple
loop through the prime factors.  The more difficult part was efficiently
finding the prime factorization of such a huge number.

I initially used my normal `primes_iterator` for this which included going
through all odd numbers below a possible prime and seeing if it divides evenly.
Once I'd already gotten the answer, I wanted to see how much faster the Sieve
of Eratosthenes was.  I implemented it pretty quickly and wow did it speed
things up!  Went from taking about 4 minutes to about 8 seconds!

## Code

```python
modulo = 1000000009

def primes_iterator(top):
    primes = [True] * (top + 1)
    for p, is_prime in enumerate(primes):
        if not is_prime or p < 2:
            continue
        yield p
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            primes[num] = False
            num += p

def solve(n):
    total = 1
    for p in primes_iterator(n):
        exp, div = 0, p
        while div <= n:
            exp += n // div
            div *= p
        total += total * pow(p, 2 * exp, modulo) % modulo
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
