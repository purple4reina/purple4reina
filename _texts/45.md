## Comments

The tough part about this problem was the runtime. Going through each integer
consecutively would have taken forever. So I then started going through all the
triangular numbers consecutively. Then I realized that the hexagonal numbers
are spaced the furthest apart. When I started with them, the script ran in less
than a minute!  Hurray!

## Code

```python
bound = 10**5

T = []
for t in range(286, bound):
	T.append(int((0.5)*(t)*(t+1)))

tmax = max(T)

P = []
for p in range(bound):
	pi = int((p)*(3*p-1)*(0.5))
	P.append(pi)
	if pi > tmax: break

H = []
for h in range(bound):
	hi = int((h)*(2*h-1))
	H.append(hi)
	if hi > tmax: break

print len(T), max(T), max(P), max(H)

for n in H:
	if n in P:
		print '**', n
		if n in T:
			print n
			break; break; break
```
