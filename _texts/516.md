COMMENTS:

This problem took me several days to finish.  I keep spinning my wheels coming
up with convoluted algorithms.  What I really needed to do was sit down with
paper and pen and look at the actual math.  This isn't an agorithms problem,
it's a math problem!

What I found is that the totient of a number is hamming if two things about the
number are true:

    1. For every prime factor p of n, (p - 1) must be a hamming number
    2. The only prime factors p of n that can have an exponent >1 are p = 2, 3, 5

These follow from the generating function for the totient:

    Where n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... pr^kr, and p1, p2, ... pr are distinct primes
    Ï†(n) = p1^(k1 - 1)*(p1 - 1) * p2^(k2 - 1)*(p2 - 1) * ... pr^(kr - 1)*(pr - 1)

After figuring this out, I stopped trying to search for the correct answers and
instead went about creating them.


CODE:

modulo = 1 << 32

_primes = []
def is_prime(n):
    n_root = int(n ** 0.5)
    for p in _primes:
        if p > n_root:
            return True
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def solve(n):

    hammings = [1]
    for p in (2, 3, 5):
        next_hammings = []
        for h in hammings:
            if h == 1 and (p == 3 or p == 5):
                continue
            for e in range(1, n):
                num = h * p ** e
                if num >= n:
                    break
                next_hammings.append(num)
        hammings.extend(next_hammings)

    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [True] * (top + 1)
    for p, prime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not prime or p < 2:
            continue
        _primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    hamming_primes = []
    for h in hammings:
        if is_prime(h + 1):
            hamming_primes.append(h + 1)

    hamming_totients = [1]
    for p in hamming_primes:
        next_hammings = []
        for h in hamming_totients:
            if p > 5:
                num = h * p
                if num > n:
                    break
                next_hammings.append(num)
            else:
                for e in range(1, n):
                    num = h * p ** e
                    if num > n:
                        break
                    next_hammings.append(num)
        hamming_totients.extend(next_hammings)
        hamming_totients.sort()

    return sum(hamming_totients) % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
