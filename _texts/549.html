COMMENTS:

For some reason I kept being pretty confused by this one.  I think it was the
backwardness of looking for the lowest number m such that m! is divisible by n.
I kept getting those two numbers swapped around in my head.

The problem itself was pretty easy.  I quickly figured out that given prime
factorization for n = p1**e1 * p2**e2 * p3**e3 ..., I just needed to find the
maximum value of s(p**e) between all the primes.  I finally settled on a
solution that uses recursion which allows me to memoize answers.

While the solution takes maybe 30 minutes to calculate, it does get the correct
answer and I'm fine with that.

Okay, I just ran the code again using pypy3 and it takes about 4 min to run.
That's so much better, I think I'm going to switch to using pypy for all my
future problems now!


CODE:

from sympy import sieve, isprime

_prime_fact = {}
def num_of_primes(n, p):
    key = (n, p)
    if key in _prime_fact:
        exp = _prime_fact[key]
    else:
        exp = 0
        while n % p == 0:
            exp += 1
            n //= p
        _prime_fact[key] = exp
    return exp

_s = {}
def s(n):
    if n in _s:
        return _s[n]

    orig_n = n

    if isprime(n):
        _s[orig_n] = n
        return n

    max_num = 1
    for p in sieve:
        if n % p != 0:
            continue

        exp = num_of_primes(n, p)
        n //= p ** exp

        mults = num = 0
        while mults < exp:
            num += p
            mults += num_of_primes(num, p)

        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
        if n == 1:
            _s[orig_n] = max_num
            return max_num
        else:
            a = max(max_num, s(n))
            _s[orig_n] = a
            return a

def S(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        total += s(k)
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(S(n))
