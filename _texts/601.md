## Comments

Yet another pattern finding problem.  I followed my same technique of getting a
brute force solution, even if it's slow.  Then I create tests and attempt to
speed it up from there.  My initial implementation allowed me to get the
answers to streaks(n).  I printed these out the first 1,000,000 values and
quickly saw that there was some type of pattern.  Plugging the sequence into
OEIS, I found https://oeis.org/A055874 which was exactly what I was looking
for.  It confirmed to me that I was going to need to find numbers that are
divisible by a range of numbers starting with one. Once doing that I was able
to count the number of values of streak(n) less than the needed value.

## Code

```python
def multipliers(n):
    mults = {1: 1}
    num = adder = 2
    for n in range(2, n + 2):
        while True:
            if num % n != 0:
                num += adder
            else:
                mults[n] = adder = num
                break
    return mults

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    mults = multipliers(n)
    this = mults[1]
    maxim = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        that = mults[k+1]
        maxim *= 4
        total += maxim // this - maxim // that
        if k < 3:
            total -= 1
        this = that
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (1, 1),
        (2, 6),
        (3, 11),
        (4, 28),
        (5, 28),
        (6, 87),
        (7, 107),
        (8, 159),
        (9, 159),
        (10, 538),
        (11, 538),
        (12, 1097),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
