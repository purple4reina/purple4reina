## Comments

For some reason, this one, again, took me longer than it should have to finish.
I think I just didn't realize I had the correct answer when I had it. Also,
important thing that I realized is that the base of the number must be less
than 10, because 10 raised to a power will have one more digit in it than the
power it is raised to.

## Code

```python
from math import log10
def n_digit(n):
	if n == 0: return 0
	return int(log10(n) + 1)

"""for n in range(1001):
	print n, n_digit(n)"""


count = 0

for power in range(1, 10**6):
	if power%100 == 0: print power
	for bass in range(1, 10):
		if n_digit(bass**power) == power: 
			count +=1
			print bass, '^', power, '=', bass**power, 'count =', count

print count
```
