## Comments

I thought I was making a really inefficient algorithm for this, but then it
ends up I was getting the answer in less than 5 seconds.  The challenge thus
was not the algorithm or the math, but actually in how I was going to deal with
possible floating point arithmetic.  I first submitted my answer by actually
calculating the float values of the slope and y-intercept.  However, this got
me the wrong answer.  I tried again using Python's Decimal module.  This
yielded a different result, but it was still wrong.  Instead I decided to go
the route of reduced fractions.  I implemented a quick greatest common divisor
function and used that to reduce the fractions.  I was worried this would be
really inefficient, but it wasn't.

## Code

```python
def points(n):
    s0 = 290797
    i = 0
    pnts = []
    while i < n:
        s1 = (s0 ** 2) % 50515093
        t0 = (s1 % 2000) - 1000
        s2 = (s1 ** 2) % 50515093
        t1 = (s2 % 2000) - 1000
        pnts.append((t0, t1))
        s0 = s2
        i += 1
    return pnts

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
       x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def reduce(a, b):
    d = gcd(a, b)
    return a // d, b // d

def equation(p0, p1):
    rise = p0[1] - p1[1]
    run = p0[0] - p1[0]

    if run == 0:
        return (1, 0, p0[0], 1)

    rise, run = reduce(rise, run)

    y_num = (p0[1] * run) - (p0[0] * rise)
    y_den = run
    y_num, y_den = reduce(y_num, y_den)

    return (rise, run, y_num, y_den)

def equations(n):
    equ = {}
    pnts = points(n)
    while pnts:
        pnt = pnts.pop()
        for p in pnts:
            equ[equation(pnt, p)] = True
    return equ

def solve(n):
    slopes = {}
    for rise, run, _, _ in equations(n):
        slopes[(rise, run)] = slopes.get((rise, run), 0) + 1
    counts = list(slopes.values())

    total = 0
    summ = sum(counts)
    while counts:
        count = counts.pop()
        summ -= count
        total += count * summ
    return total * 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve, points

_test_solve = (
        (3, 6),
        (100, 24477690),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)

_test_points = (
        (3, [(527, 144), (-488, 732), (-454, -947)]),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_points)
def test_points(n, expect):
    assert expect == points(n)
```
