COMMENTS:

I wasn't able to get this problem to run in under a couple hours.  I think the
problem is neeeding to search through so many primes in order to get the
largest prime factor of the form `p = 4*k + 1`.  I was hoping that Python
slices would do the trick so I didn't have to start at the very beginning of
the primes list with every call to factor.  But, ends up that Python will make
a copy of the list when creating the slice.  That's really annoying because I
know that Go will just point the slice to the same underlying array as the
original.  I didn't feel like rewriting the whole thing in Go though.  I tried
many things to try to get the time down, but nothing seemed to work.  This form
with the recursion was the fastest I could devise.

The problem itself was pretty interesting and I found myself getting crosseyed
trying to make sense of all the crazy patterns and interconnections I was
discovering.  First off, I quickly figured that for the equation `q*p = n**2 +
k**2` where q, n, and k are integers and p a prime, `p = 2*n + 1` and n must be
even.  This lead me to the sequence of Pythagorean primes
https://oeis.org/A002144.

I next printed out the values of q, p, n, and k for the values of P(k) for k
less than 100.  Here is where I found an interesting pattern!  For some reason
that I was unable to prove, p always evenly divided `4 * k**2 + 1`.  I think
used this fact to just run through all primes of the form `4*x + 1` and pick
the largest that divides `4 * k**2 + 1`.


CODE:

_factor = {1: 0}
def factor(n):
    if n in _factor:
        return _factor[n]
    n_root = int(n ** 0.5) + 1
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            fact = max(p, factor(n // p))
            break
        if p > n_root:
            fact = n
            break
    else:
        raise AssertionError('cannot factor %d' % n)
    _factor[n] = fact
    return fact

modulo = 10 ** 18
maxi = 10 ** 8
sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (maxi - 1)
primes = []
for p, is_prime in enumerate(sieve):
    if not is_prime:
        continue
    if (p - 1) % 4 == 0:
        primes.append(p)
    _factor[p] = p
    num = p + p
    while num <= maxi:
        sieve[num] = False
        num += p

def solve(top):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, top + 1):
        total += factor(4 * k ** 2 + 1)
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys, time
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    st = time.time()
    s = solve(n)
    en = time.time()
    print(s, en - st)
