## Comments

This problem was pretty easy for me.  I feel like I've gotten pretty good at
this type of algorithm.  I used a similar approach to how I tackled problem 88
just a couple weeks ago.

The math behind this was pretty simple.  First thing I did was implement a
brute force approach.  Then I printed all the solutions below 100 and wrote out
their prime factorizations.  That confirmed my suspicions.  In order to find
all the solutions, all I needed to do was find products of at least three
primes where the last prime added is less than the product of the preceding
ones.  I used recursion and the sieve of Eratosthenes to create the primes.
Code runs in about 51 seconds.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):

    top = int(n ** 0.5)
    sieve = [True] * (top + 1)
    primes = []
    for p, is_prime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not is_prime or p < 2:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p + p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

    def get_smooth(product, length, i):
        length += 1
        smooths = 0
        for p in primes[i:]:
            prod = product * p
            if prod > n:
                break
            elif length > 2 and p < product:
                smooths += 1
            if n // prod >= p:
                smooths += get_smooth(prod, length, i)
            i += 1
        return smooths

    return get_smooth(1, 0, 0) + 1


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10**1, 2),
        (10**2, 29),
        (10**3, 274),
        (10**4, 2656),
        (10**5, 26613),
        (10**6, 268172),
        (10**7, 2719288),
        #(10**8, 27531694),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
