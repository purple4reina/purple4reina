Finishing two in one day does feel nice.

I'm really liking Ruby's ability to memoize.  In this solution I used a Hash so
I could avoid recreating large powers of 10 over and over again.  That allowed
me to cut the time down significantly.

The final solution required 20 digits of precision.  I was hoping to be able to
do it with fewer, but no luck.  I had to run it a few times with different
precisions in order to finally come to the answer.

Using 'ruby-prof' for a profiler really helps.  It allowed me to test out
different implementations and know exectly where my algorithm was most slow.  I
tried new ways thinking they'd be faster only to find they weren't.  It was
very interesting at times.

The hardest part of this problem was determining if a number started with some
particular digits.  The obvious solution is to change the number to a string
and then call `String#start_with?` on it.  But that was incredibly slow.

## Code

```ruby
class Problem
  POWERS_OF_TEN = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = 10.pow(key) }

  class << self
    def p(l, n)
      power = 0
      num_found = 0
      len = num_digits(l)
      raised = 1
      loop do
        power += 1
        raised *= 2
        raised = truncate(raised, 20)
        if truncate(raised, len) == l
          num_found += 1
          return power if num_found == n
        end
      end
    end

    def truncate num, len
      return 0 if len < 1
      diff = num_digits(num) - len
      return num if diff < 1
      power = POWERS_OF_TEN[diff]
      return num.div(power)
    end

    def num_digits num
      num.to_s.length
    end
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  puts Problem.p(123, 678910)
end
```

## Tests

```ruby
require 'test/unit'
require './problem'

class TestProblem < Test::Unit::TestCase
  [
    [ 12,  1,     7],
    [ 12,  2,    80],
    [123, 45, 12710],
  ].each do |l, n, expect|
    define_method "test_p_#{l}_#{n}" do
      assert_equal expect, Problem.p(l, n)
    end
  end

  [
    [12345, 0, 0],
    [12345, 1, 1],
    [12345, 2, 12],
    [12345, 3, 123],
    [12345, 4, 1234],
    [12345, 5, 12345],
    [12345, 40, 12345],
  ].each do |num, len, expect|
    define_method "test_truncate_#{num}_#{len}" do
      assert_equal expect, Problem.truncate(num, len)
    end
  end
end
```
