COMMENTS:

I started by implementing a pretty brute force method of calculating.  But of
course since it would mean going through 10**16 iterations, this would never
have been feasible.  But, it allowed me to write some tests and do some
analysis.

I printed out the values for f(n, k) and noticed an easy pattern.

    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
          1  1  2  2  3  3  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  9  9
                   1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3  4  4  4  5  5  5
                               1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  3  3  3
                                              1  1  1  1  1  2

The solution was just to put this pattern into code, and since I'd already
written some good tests, that work was pretty easy.


CODE:

modulo = 1000000007

def solve(num):
    total = tri = addr = 0
    while True:
        addr += 1
        tri += addr
        if tri > num:
            break
        div, mod = divmod(num - tri + 1, addr)
        total += div * (div + 1) // 2 * addr + mod * (div + 1)
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))


TESTS:

import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (1, 1),
        (2, 3),
        (3, 7),
        (4, 12),
        (5, 19),
        (6, 28),
        (7, 39),
        (8, 51),
        (9, 66),
        (10**1, 83),
        (10**2, 12656),
        (10**3, 1817711),
        (10**4, 238998218),
        (10**5, 651877630),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
