## Comments

It took me several tries to come up with the most efficient way to get Euler's
totient of a number. Ends up the fastest one was the one that took the fewest
number of times through a for loop. The final code along with the two previous
tries are below.

## Resources

I used wikipedia to find several different algorithms for calculating Euler's
totient.

## Code

```python
def isprime(n):
	if n == 0 or n == 1: return False
	for i in range(2, int(n**0.5 + 1)):
		if n%i == 0: return False
	return True

primes = []
for n in range(10**6):
	if isprime(n) == True:
		primes.append(n)

def phi(n):
	pfact = []
	answer = float(n)
	if isprime(n) == True: pfact.append(n)
	for p in primes:
		if p > (n**.5 + 1):
			for f in pfact:
				answer = answer * (1 - (1/float(f)))
			return answer
		elif n%p == 0:
			pfact.append(p)

phis = [[0]]
for n in range(1, 10**6 +1):
	phis.append([float(n/phi(n)), n])

print max(phis)
```

## Try One

```python
def phi(n):
	if n == 1: return 1
	count = 0
	for k in range(1, n):
		for i in range(2, k+1):
			if (k%i == 0) and (n%i == 0):
				break
		else:
			count += 1
	return count

maximum = [0, 0]
for n in range(1, 10**6 + 1):
	if n%1000 == 0: print n
	if float(n / phi(n)) > maximum[0]:
		maximum = [float(n / phi(n)), n]
	
print maximum
```

## Try Two

```python
def gcd(n, k):
	if n%k == 0: return k
	else: return gcd(k, n%k)

def phi(n):
	count = 0
	for k in range(1, n+1):
		if gcd(n, k) == 1:
			count += 1
	return count

phis = [[0]]
for n in range(10**6, 1, -1):
	print n, max(phis)
	phis.append([float(n/phi(n)), n])
	
print max(phis)
```
