COMMENTS:

I grabbed this problem to work on because I feel like I've been doing a bunch
of problems using divisors.  So I felt like I was well prepared for it.  I was
able to solve it pretty quickly because of that.

Seems like with a lot of these problems where you're counting the occurance of
something, I will start by running through all the numbers and checking for all
the things.  Then I'll realize how slow that'll be and change to trying to
produce the things instead.  That was my exact process in this case.  10 ** 18
is a very large number to be running all the way through!  I do think starting
by running all the numbers is a good idea because then I can write some good
working tests.  Once I do that I have confidence to make sweeping changes to
the code.


CODE:

from sympy import sieve

def S(n):
    total = n
    cube_fulls = set([1])
    for p in sieve.primerange(1, int(n ** (1 / 3)) + 1):
        new_cube_fulls = set(cube_fulls)
        cube = p ** 3
        max_add = n // cube
        for full in cube_fulls:
            mult = full * cube
            while mult <= n:
                total += n // mult
                if mult < max_add:
                    new_cube_fulls.add(mult)
                mult *= p
        cube_fulls = new_cube_fulls

    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(S(n))
