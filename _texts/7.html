TRY ONE:

COMMENTS:
This code works great. But it becomes incredibly slow when needing to reach into those highest numbers. I was
able to get the 9500th prime using this.

Making sure to refer to the list as "a reference to" in applescript helped speed things up. But I still think I
need a new approach.

CODE:

set all_int to {}
set all_int_ref to a reference to all_int
set primes_list to {}
set primes_list_ref to a reference to primes_list
set bound to 10000
set t to (time of (current date))

repeat with i from 1 to bound
	copy i to the end of all_int_ref
end repeat

set j to 2
repeat while j < (bound - 1)
	
	if item j of all_int_ref is not false then
		copy item j of all_int_ref to the end of primes_list_ref
		try
			repeat with n from 2 to bound
				set item (j * n) of all_int_ref to false
			end repeat
		end try
	end if
	set j to j + 1
	
end repeat

log ((time of (current date)) - t)
log (count primes_list)
return primes_list



TRY TWO:

COMMENTS:
Trying to use google to find a list of the first 15000 consecutive integers found nothing. Generating this list 
on my own was fast, only a few seconds. But using this list gave a "stack overflow" error.

This next script worked to make the list of consecutive numbers smaller with each repeat. While it worked great with bound=10,000 it was still not powerful enough to handle the number sizes I need.

CODE:

set all_int to {}
set all_int_ref to a reference to all_int
set primes_list to {}
set primes_list_ref to a reference to primes_list
set bound to 100000
set t to (time of (current date))

repeat with i from 2 to bound
	copy i to the end of all_int_ref
end repeat


repeat
	if item 1 of all_int_ref is not false then
		copy (item 1 of all_int_ref) to this_prime
		copy this_prime to the end of primes_list_ref
		try
			repeat with n from 1 to bound
				set item ((this_prime * n) + 1) of all_int_ref to false
			end repeat
		end try
	end if
	try
		copy (items 2 thru (count all_int_ref) of all_int_ref) to all_int
	on error
		exit repeat
	end try
end repeat

log ((time of (current date)) - t)
log (count primes_list)
log primes_list
try
	return item 10001 of primes_list
end try



TRY THREE:

COMMENTS:
I feel like I am getting no closer to the answer than when I began. I've added timing counts into the script so 
I can see how changes in it effect the load. It seems like the changes I've been making aren't making it any 
more efficient. Time for a new strategy.


CODE:

set all_int to {}
set all_int_ref to a reference to all_int
set primes_list to {}
set primes_list_ref to a reference to primes_list
set new_int to {}
set new_int_ref to a reference to new_int
set bound to 30000
set half_bound to (bound / 2)
set t to (time of (current date))

repeat with i from 2 to bound
	copy i to the end of all_int_ref
end repeat

repeat
	--log all_int
	if (item 1 of all_int) < half_bound then
		set this_prime to (item 1 of all_int_ref)
		copy this_prime to the end of primes_list_ref
		repeat with m from 1 to (count all_int_ref)
			copy (item m of all_int_ref) to n
			if ((n / this_prime) mod 1 is not 0) and (n is not this_prime) then copy n to the end of new_int_ref
		end repeat
		copy new_int to all_int
		set new_int to {}
	else
		log ((time of (current date)) - t)
		return primes_list_ref & all_int_ref
		
		
	end if
end repeat


--log ((time of (current date)) - t)
--log (count primes_list_ref)
return primes_list
try
	return item 10001 of primes_list
end try



TRY FOUR:

COMMENTS:
This script has managed to cut 5 seconds off the time to evaluate 50,000 integers. I'm hoping that will be 
enough of a difference when it comes to the biggest numbers. My strategy was to cut down the number of "repeat" 
statements I'm using, thus cutting the amount of computation. I used a handler that evaluates if an integer is 
prime or not. This way, I don't have to create the big list of integers first, because a repeat statement 
already has ordered integers built in to it.


RESULTS:
It's good!


CODE:

set primes_list to {}
set primes_list_ref to a reference to primes_list
set t to (time of (current date))


repeat with this_num from 2 to 150000
	copy is_this_prime(this_num, primes_list_ref) to this_eval
	if this_eval is not {} then copy this_eval to the end of primes_list_ref
	if (count (primes_list_ref)) = 10001 then return item 10001 of primes_list_ref
end repeat

to is_this_prime(a_num, primes_list)
	repeat with a_prime in primes_list
		if (a_num / a_prime mod 1 is 0) then
			return {}
		end if
	end repeat
	return a_num
end is_this_prime

log ((time of (current date)) - t)
log (count primes_list_ref)
return primes_list
