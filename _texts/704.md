## Comments

After completing problem 679, this one felt like a breeze.  I did my normal
process of implementing a brute force algorithm, writing some tests, and then
iterating from there.  I started by printing out the values for F(n) and
quickly saw that there was a pattern to them.  I figured out the pattern,
noting that they are the values from https://oeis.org/A119387, and then write
it in code.  Because the algorithm took several steps, I wrote out the comments
first and was sure to give the variables clear names.

Gets the solution in under a second.  In fact, can even calculate the value for
10**100 in less than a second!  The only thing keeping this puppy from going
any larger is python's recursion limit.

## Code

```python
import math

def solve_by_power(k):
    # the n will be (2**e - 1)
    last = 0
    total = 0
    for e in range(1, k+1):
        this = int((e-1)*2**(e-2)) + last
        total += this
        last = this
    return total

_solve = {0: 0, 1: 0}
def solve(n):
    if n in _solve:
        return _solve[n]

    # total to nearest power of 2
    nearest_power_of_2 = int(math.log(n, 2))
    total = solve_by_power(nearest_power_of_2)

    # figure out how many numbers are left total
    total_num_left = n - 2**nearest_power_of_2 + 1

    # figure out how many numbers are left from previous
    num_from_prev = total_num_left // 2
    further_power_of_2 = 2 ** (nearest_power_of_2 - 1) - 1
    total += solve(further_power_of_2 + num_from_prev) - solve(further_power_of_2)

    # get the alternator number
    total += nearest_power_of_2 * (total_num_left - num_from_prev)

    _solve[n] = total
    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10**1, 14),
        (10**2, 389),
        (10**3, 7002),
        (10**4, 103649),
        (10**5, 1368968),
        (10**6, 16951471),
        (10**7, 203222840),
        (10**8, 2365782338),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
