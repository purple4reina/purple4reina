## Comments

This problem frustrated me soooooo much! I worked for sooo long on it, then
after hours and hours of toil, I realized the problem was in my division
algorithm. After all that time, I had just forgotten to add a zero.

When I was done, I looked at the forums for this problem. It made me really sad
that everyone said how easy it was. Most everyone just did it in their heads.
It really bummed me out to see that, but I think I'm going to keep checking the
forums to get hints and new ideas for future problems.

You can see in my final code, which I've included here, that I worked through
many many different functions and definitions to try to get to the answer. Ends
up, I used hardly any of them. Because, it was just an error in my division
function that all along was causing me grief.

## Code

```python
bound = 10**6
from math import *
from time import time

short = 7
longs = 100

n = 3; d = 7; m = 1; mult = []
while d*m <= 10**6:
	mult.append([n*m, d*m])
	m += 1
	
def reduce2(x, y):
	if [x, y] in mult: return True
	else: return False

def reduce(x, y):
	for i in range(2, x+1):
		while x%i == y%i == 0:
			x = x / i
			y = y / i
	return x, y

def isprime(n):
	if n == 1 or n == 0: return False
	for i in range(2, int(n**.5 + 1)):
		if n%i == 0: return False
	return True

def primeslist(bounds):
	primes = []
	for n in range(bounds+1):
		if isprime(n) == True: primes.append(n)
	return primes

def divide(x, y):
	x = int(x)
	y = int(y)
	z = []
	while len(z) < short:
		if (x / y) >= 1:
			z.append(x / y)
			x = x%y * 10
		else:
			x = x*10
			z.append(0)
	return str(''.join(map(str, z[1:])))

def dividelong(x, y):
	x = int(x)
	y = int(y)
	z = []
	while len(z) < longs:
		if (x / y) >= 1:
			z.append(x / y)
			x = x%y * 10
		else:
			x = x*10
			z.append(0)
	return str(''.join(map(str, z[1:])))

def addmult(n, d, mult):
	m = 1
	while d*m <= 10**6:
		mult.append([n*m, d*m])
		m += 1
	return mult


answers = [[dividelong(3, 7), 3, 7]]
test = divide(3, 7)
start = time(); print 0, len(answers), 0
for d in range(7, bound + 1):
	if d%10000 == 0:
		end = time()
		print d, len(answers), end-start
		start = end
	
	n = int(floor(float(d)*float(3)/float(7)))
	this = divide(n, d)
	if (this == test):
		answers.append([dividelong(n, d), n, d])
		

print sorted(answers)
```
