## Comments

At first I thought this problem was an algorithms problem.  I spent several
days perfecting an algorithm to create all the palendromic compositions of
numbers that contained a 2.  But I realized that even if I made the world's
best algorithm, it still wouldn't be fast enough because of the sheer number of
compositions that I needed to sift through and count.

So I took a step back and thought about the issue from a combinatorics lens.  I
did a lot of reading and poking on the internet and discovered the "stars and
bars" method.  This was a real breakthrough.  I was then able to very easily
calculate the total number of compositions of a number that are palendromic.

From there I searched for a way to find either compositions that included a 2
or compositions that excluded 2s.  In playing around on oeis.org I found
https://oeis.org/A005251 which was the exact sequence I needed!  I grabbed the
generating function and that lead me to the solution.

## Code

```python
modulo = 1000000

def solve(to=float('inf')):
    last_no_2 = n = 0
    while n < to:
        n += 1
        total = 1 << n // 2

        if n % 2 == 0:
            last_no_2 += no_2(n // 2)
            total += no_2((n - 2) // 2)
        total -= last_no_2 + 1

        if total % modulo == 0 and total > modulo:
            break

    return n, total

_perms = {}
def no_2(n):
    if n in _perms:
        return _perms[n]
    elif n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n < 3:
        return 1
    p = no_2(n - 1) + no_2(n - 2) + no_2(n - 4)
    _perms[n] = p
    return p

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = float(sys.argv[1])
    a, _ = solve(n)
    print(a)
```
