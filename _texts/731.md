Before I started working on this problem, I wrote the following in my notes:

I definitely learned something about continued fractions.  At first I thought I
would have to find the exact period of each decimal expansion.  This lead me to
learning about Multiplicative Order.  I still don't totally grok what it is and
why it can be useful.  I hope that further problems use it more.

My final solution didn't end up using Multiplicative Order at all though.  It
was mostly by chance that I figured out that `n % t` gives the same value as `n
% (multiplicative order of t)`.

Update: and now after exploring a bit more, I realize that I don't even need
the mod in `n % t - 1`.  Simply `n - 1` will suffice.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):
    t, total = 3, 0
    while t <= n:
        m, a = 1, 0
        mod = n % t - 1
        if mod > 0:
            m = pow(10, mod, t)
        for _ in range(15):
            d, m = divmod(m * 10, t)
            a = (a * 10 + d)
        total += a
        t *= 3
    return (total // 10**5) % 10**10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10**1, 4444444444),
        (10**2, 4938271604),
        (10**3, 8326474622),
        (10**4, 5863435451),
        (10**5, 2187843993),
        (10**6, 9851385196),
        (10**7, 5158680727),
        (10**8, 2584642393),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
