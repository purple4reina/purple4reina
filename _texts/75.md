## Comments

I don't think I did a very good job on this one. I did get the correct answer,
but it took the program over an hour to come to the answer. Not very efficient.
What did get it at least partially there is knowing that to make a primitive
triple, m and n must be coprime. This made things much faster and more
efficient.

## Code

```python
from time import time
from fractions import gcd
start = time(); end = time()

all_triples = set()
for n in range(1, 1225):
	end, start = time() - start, time()
	print n, end
	if 2*(n+1)*(2*n+1) > 1500000:
		break
	for m in range(n+1, 1225, 2):
		if (gcd(m, n) != 1):
			continue
		if 2*m*(m+n) > 1500000:
			break
		for k in range(1, 1500000):
			a = k*(m**2 - n**2)
			b = k*(2*m*n)
			c = k*(m**2 + n**2)
			triple = tuple(sorted([a, b, c]))
			if a+b+c <= 1500000:
				all_triples |= {triple}
			elif a+b+c > 1500000:
				break

duplicates = set()
unique = set()
for t in all_triples:
	tsum = sum(t)
	if tsum in duplicates:
		continue
	elif tsum in unique:
		duplicates.add(tsum)
		unique.remove(tsum)
	elif tsum not in unique:
		unique.add(tsum)

print len(unique)
```
