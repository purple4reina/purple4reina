COMMENTS:

I looked up Monopoly on Wikipedia which lead me to a couple of outside 
webpages and the concept of the Markov chain.

I did not make a Markov chain for this problem. Instead I used the "Monte 
Carlo" method. I had the script roll the dice a million times (literally) and 
keep track of where it lands each time based on the rules given. The squares 
that at the end of the million rolls had the most visits also had the highest 
probability.

This method took longer than if I used a Markov chain, but it was effective 
nonetheless.


CODE:

from random import randint

def rules(next):
	# go to jail:
	if next == 30:
		return 10
	
	# comunity chest:
	elif next == 2 or next == 17 or next == 33:
		CC = randint(1,16)
		if CC == 1:
			return 0
		elif CC == 2:
			return 10
		else:
			return next
	
	# chance:
	elif next == 7 or next == 22 or next == 36:
		CH = randint(1,16)
		if CH == 1:
			return 0
		elif CH == 2:
			return 10
		elif CH == 3:
			return 11
		elif CH == 4:
			return 24
		elif CH == 5:
			return 39
		elif CH == 6:
			return 5
		elif CH == 7 or CH == 8:
			if next == 7:
				return 15
			elif next == 22:
				return 25
			elif next == 36:
				return 5
		elif CH == 9:
			if next == 7 or next == 36:
				return 12
			elif next == 22:
				return 28
		elif CH == 10:
			return rules(next-3)
		else:
			return next
	
	else:
		return next
