COMMENTS:

The math behind this one was pretty simple, which is what made this 
problem so cool. I calculated for each different size of rectangle within 
the larger rectangle, the number of possible places this size could be. 
Then add all those together, and the final number of possible recangles 
appears!

The challenge for some reason for me was finding how to get to the optimal 
rectangle. I knew I couldn't search through every single one, of every 
single size, espcially knowing that the orientation of height and width 
didn't matter. I used the guess and check method to figure out how to do 
it.


CODE:

close = [2*10**6, 0]
for height in range(1, 2*10**6):
	last_width = 0
	for width in range(1, height):	
		count = 0
		for y in range(height):
			for x in range(width):
				count += ((width-x)*(height-y))
		this_close = [abs(2*10**6 - count), count, height, width, width*height]
		print this_close
		if this_close[0] < close[0]:
			close = this_close
			print '^ NEW ^'
		if count > 2*10**6 + close[0]:
			last_width = width
			break
	if last_width == 1:
		break
	
print close
