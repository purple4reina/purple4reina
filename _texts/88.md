OMFG!  Yes, I finally finished this one!  I've been working on this problem off
and on for about 8 years and I finally got it!  I think what finally did it is
a better understanding of how to create integer partitions.  I'd developed a
really stellar algorithm to do so for a previous problem and just went from
that point for this one.

My solution uses recursion.  Python's recursion limit is 1000 and since 12000
is much larger than that, I had to set the recursion limit much higher to
account.  However, I wasn't able to run the code in pypy3.  I kept giving me
segmentation faults and I suspect it has to do with the amount of recursion
happening.  Would have been much faster running it in pypy3, but alas, this
runs in about 8 minutes on python3.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):

    def partition(start, end, summ, prod, count):
        k = start
        while k > end:
            s, p = summ + k, prod * k
            if s == p and count > 1:
                if s < minimals[count]:
                    minimals[count] = s
            elif count < n and s >= p:
                st = start
                if p > 1:
                    st = s // (p - 1)
                partition(st, k - 1, s, p, count + 1)
            k -= 1

    minimals = {i: float('inf') for i in range(2, n+1)}
    partition(n, 0, 0, 1, 1)
    return sum(set(minimals.values()))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    sys.setrecursionlimit(n * 2)
    print(solve(n))
```
