## Comments

I first tried this problem by going through every value possible for the sides
of the triangle. But for some reason, it just never gave me the correct answer.

In this version, I generate the set of (mostly) primitive Pythagorean triples,
then test to see which fulfill the requirements. This strategy worked great.

## Code

```python
from fractions import *

bound = 10**9
tested = set()
total = 0

for n in xrange(1, bound):
	if n%100 == 0: print n, total
	for m in xrange(n+1, bound):
		a = (m**2 - n**2)
		b = (2*m*n)
		c = (m**2 + n**2)
		if c > 350*10**6: break
		if (2*a == c+1) and ((c+1, c+1, 2*a) not in tested) and ((2*(c+1) + 2*a) <= bound):
			tested.add((c+1, c+1, 2*a))
			total += (2*(c+1) + 2*a)
		if (2*a == c-1) and ((c-1, c-1, 2*a) not in tested) and ((2*(c-1) + 2*a) <= bound):
			tested.add((c-1, c-1, 2*a))
			total += (2*(c-1) + 2*a)
		if (2*b == c+1) and ((c+1, c+1, 2*b) not in tested) and ((2*(c+1) + 2*b) <= bound):
			tested.add((c+1, c+1, 2*b))
			total += (2*(c+1) + 2*b)
		if (2*b == c-1) and ((c-1, c-1, 2*b) not in tested) and ((2*(c-1) + 2*b) <= bound):
			tested.add((c-1, c-1, 2*b))
			total += (2*(c-1) + 2*b)
								
			
print total
```
