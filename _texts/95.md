## Comments

I used the same strategy as I used for [Problem 179](179) in finding the number
of factors of a number. I used a set to eliminate the numbers that I'd already
dug through. This sped things up a bit. I also threw out any string of
amicables where the next number was less than the first one.

## Code

```python
ans = [0,0]
nset = set(range(10**6+1))

def nextam(n):
	fact = [1]
	for i in range(2, int(n**.5)+1):
		if n%i == 0:
			fact.append(i)
			if n/i != i:
				fact.append(n/i)
	return sum(fact)

while len(nset) > 0:
	number = nset.pop()
	n = number
	if n%10**4 == 0: print n, len(nset), ans[0]
	amlist = [n]
	done = False
	count = 0
	while done == False:
		next = nextam(n)
		count += 1
		if next > 10**6 or count > 10**3 or next < number:
			break
		elif next == number:
			done = True
		else:
			amlist.append(next)
		n = next	
	if done == True:
		nset -= set(amlist)
		if count > ans[0]:
			ans = [count, number]

print ans
```
