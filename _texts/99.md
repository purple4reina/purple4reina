## Try One

### Comments

The numbers here are just way to big to work with. Also, it's really
inefficient to use the power function with these large numbers.

## Code

```python
def power(b, e):
	answer = 1
	for i in range(e):
		answer = answer * b
	return answer

n = 1

number = [0, 0]
for p in pairs[:5]:
	print p, n
	big = power(p[0], p[1])
	if big > number[0]:
		number = [big, n]
	n += 1

print number[1]
```

## Try Two

## Comments

It finally dawned on me to use logorithms to solve this one. It made the
numbers smaller and easier to deal with. With that change, the problem was
solvable in under 1 second.

## Code

```python
big = [0, 0]
for i in range(len(p)):
	this = [p[i][1]*log(p[i][0]), i+1]
	if this[0] > big[0]:
		big = this

print big
```
