<p>I first tried to not use any brains and just play the game a million times and
see if the bank lost. That didn’t work out because it was really really slow,
and didn’t always come up with the correct value.</p>

<p>Instead, I did the math. There were two steps to it. The first and toughest
part was getting the probability of winning. This depended on there being a
greater number of blues pulled than reds. So, I needed to find the product of
1’s and some numbers, where those numbers were based on the exact turn from
which the blue was pulled. That took a little work to get it to come out right.</p>

<p>The easier part was figuring out if the bank won. I wrote out the simple
algorithm for this. I had the payout variable increase until the bank lost.</p>

<p>Below I’ve included both of the tries I made, the latter being the one that
worked.</p>

			bag.append('r')

				blues += 1

			money -= payout

	print payout, money, wins
