<p>I think I’m on a roll now with these things. I mean, doing two in a row is a
roll right???</p>

<p>This problem I decided to do in Go since that’s the language I’m now working
with at work. Plus, it’s a lot faster than Python. Not that the added speed is
required to solve the problems, but it’s nice.</p>

<p>Again, this problem took me two tries. First, I started by creating a
“simulation” and running it about 100 million times, then finding the average
of all those simulation tries. Ends up this isn’t nearly good enough. Since the
problem was looking for accuracy to the 9th decimal place, this means I would
need to run at the very least 10^9 simulations. I optimized my simulation as
much as I could and still realized that this would be impossible to run.</p>

<p>Next I decided to do the hard work that it would take to actually do the math
correctly. I took discrete math in college, I can do this right? This method
proved to be the right one and the program ran in about 0.13 seconds! Pretty
good! I looked up some code to do Combinations in Go. This lead me to a repo
that was no longer maintained but still had a good example of how to generate
all combinations of a set of numbers. I started with this and slowly edited it
to include repeated values up to 10 times.</p>

<p>I ran the program at this point and found that the answer was incorrect. This
is because for each possible combination, there are multiple ways to pull this
grouping of balls out of the urn. This means each combination needed to be
weighted. I then added calculations for the weight and ran it again. Still
wrong. Sigh. Coming back to it after a short break, I wrote a quick test for
what I’d expect the weight to be on the second pick. The test failed! This
pointed me to two different bugs in my weight calculation. Once fixing these, I
was able to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Also, git was super helpful to me in this problem and the last. I did not push
my code anywhere but still got a ton of value out of it. It was really nice to
be able to go back to my very first commit and show how the subtle bugs in my
weight algorithm were incorrect. Very helpful!</p>
