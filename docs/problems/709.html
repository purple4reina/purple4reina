<p>I started by creating a brute force problem along with tests.  Of course this
was going to be too slow.  I tried a couple of things to try to speed it up,
but all were too minute.  I then started to look for patterns in the output.
I printed the number possibilities for the number of bags in the cupboard after
each one is added.  There were a couple of patterns I noticed, but the most
important is that the odd numbered rows start with a value that is the sum of
the previous row.  Since I was looking for the sum of a row, this was the
solution I was looking for.  It is important that the number of bags he puts
into the closet is even.</p>

<p>I then went to search OEIS for this sequence and learned about Euler Numbers.
Thereâ€™s lots of sequences based off them.  I grabbed a generating function from
there and got the answer in under 4 seconds.</p>

<p>I do feel strange that I grabbed some code off OEIS for this.  Does that count
as me solving the problem?  Do I get points for searching and coming across the
right number sequence?  I think in the future I will try to understand the
problem a bit better and be able to come up with my own generating function.</p>
