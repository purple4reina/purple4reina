COMMENTS:

This one took forever! It's been several days since I've completed a problem 
so I'm feeling pretty good about finishing one again. I've had to do this one 
several times.

I had to do several things to make this one come out. I used dictionaries to 
keep track only of the last digit of the numbers.

Because those numbers that are the same number in each digit would be counted 
twice: first in the up numbers and second in the down numbers. Those were 
eliminated at the end.

With the completion of this problem, I've now made it to Level 5!! Woopee!


CODE:

Udict = dict(zip(range(1,10),[1]*9))
Ddict = dict(zip(range(1,10),[1]*9))
Ddict[0] = 0
count = 18

for i in xrange(99):
	newdict = dict(zip(range(10),[0]*10))
	for key in Udict.iterkeys():
		for x in range(key, 10):
			newdict[x] += Udict[key]
	Udict = newdict.copy()
	for value in Udict.itervalues():
		count += value

for i in xrange(99):
	newdict = dict(zip(range(10),[0]*10))
	for key in Ddict.iterkeys():
		for x in range(key+1):
			newdict[x] += Ddict[key]
	Ddict = newdict.copy()
	for value in Ddict.itervalues():
		count += value
			
print count - (100*9)
