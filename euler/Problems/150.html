COMMENTS:

I feel like I'm getting to the point with these problems where Python is just not going 
to be fast enough. It took over an hour for this one to run and unless there's some 
clever and more logical way to do it, then I'm at a loss to figure out how it could run 
any faster than that.

With my first try at this problem, I found that I was having it calculate the same thing 
multiple times. This meant going through many for and while loops for each test. I 
solved this by creating a couple of arrays to store the values in. I think this is one 
place that I could find a way to work up the speed. There are probably faster ways to 
store data with Python, but I'm not sure how.


CODE:

# bounds

low = 1
high = 500500
rows = 1000


# definitions

def random(low, high):
	t = 0 
	for k in range(low, high): 
	    t = (615949*t + 797807) % 2**20 
	    yield t - 2**19

def trirow(k):
	n = 1
	while k > (n * (n + 1) / 2):
		n += 1
	return n

def trisum(start, depth):
	diff = trirowdict[start]
	total = randlist[start]
	r = 1
	while r < depth:
		r += 1
		next = start + diff
		total += randlist[next]
		for i in range(1, r):
			total += randlist[next + i]
		start = next + i
	return total	

def trisumiter(start, depth):
	diff = trirowdict[start]
	total = randlist[start]
	yield total
	r = 1
	while r < depth:
		r += 1
		next = start + diff
		total += randlist[next]
		for i in range(1, r):
			total += randlist[next + i]
		start = next + i
		yield total


# create arrays

randlist = [0]
for r in random(low, high + 1):
	randlist.append(r)
randlist = tuple(randlist)

trirowdict = dict()
for n in range(low, high + 1):
	trirowdict[n] = trirow(n)


# search by brute force

prev = 10**7
for start in range(len(randlist)):
	if start == 0: continue
	startrow = trirowdict[start]
	if startrow == rows: continue
	trisumdict = dict()
	print start
	for thissum in trisumiter(start, rows + 1 - startrow):
		if thissum < prev:
			prev = thissum
			

print prev
