COMMENTS:


This was another easier seeming problem (though it is marked as 20% difficulty
out of 100%, so obviously others must think it was harder than I did).
Initially I read the problem wrong.  I thought I was suppose to just find the
transitions from one prime to the next.  When I kept getting the wrong answer
over and over, I reread the problem and found there was a step I was missing.
I needed to find the "digital root" of each prime number.

I'm in a book club at work where we are reading and learning together about Go
Programming.  In the book this last week we read about integer types.  One of
the things they covered was bitwise operations.  For some reason, even though
this wasn't the first time I'd read about them, they finally seem to have made
sense to me.  So, I decided to pull out an XOR in this problem to help solve
it.  I had initially started by actually counting to figure out the transition
changes between each number, but after finding so many errors in my code, I
knew I needed a different way.

Lastly, I had initially created a custom prime generator.  It was rather slow.
The problem took over 11 minutes to complete.  When done, I read the forum to
see what other people did.  There I was reminded of the Sieve of Eratosthenes!
Oh yeah!  Duh, this is a great application of that.  So, I rewrote my generator
and found the problem being soved in about 56 seconds!  Nice work, thanks
Eratosthenes!!
