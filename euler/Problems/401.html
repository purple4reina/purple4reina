COMMENTS:

I think for this one I was just trying to be too clever for too long.  Once I
stopped trying to be clever, I got the answer quite quickly.

At first I tried to go through all the numbers and calculate the divisors for
each.  But after taking a couple days off from the problem, I realized that all
I needed to do was count the number of numbers below n are divisible by any
given number.  This made finding the sum much easier and faster because ends up
I only had to search through the square-root of n number of numbers.


CODE:

modulo = 10**9

def _sum_of_squares(n):
    return n * (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1) // 6

def sum_of_squares(minn, maxx):
    return _sum_of_squares(maxx) - _sum_of_squares(minn)

def solve(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        total += (k ** 2) * (n // k)
    for k in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        group = k * sum_of_squares(n//(k+1), n//k)
        total += group
    if k ** 3 == group:
        total -= group
    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
