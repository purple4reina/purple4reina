COMMENTS:

This problem was great. There have been several problems so far that 
involve fractions. I used the phi function again, but this time found a 
way to maximize it. I learned that sets are much faster to access than 
lists. So, I kept both a list and a set of primes. This made it really 
quick to check and see if a number was prime or not, because checking to 
see if that number is in the set of primes was very fast. 

I also kept a dictionary of the prime factorizations of numbers. This 
allowed me to find the prime factors of large numbers very quickly.


CODE:

from fractions import *
count = 1
bound = 10**6

def isprime(n):
	if n == 0 or n == 1: return False
	for i in range(2, int(n**0.5 + 1)):
		if n%i == 0: return False
	return True

primes = []
for n in range(bound):
	if isprime(n) == True:
		primes.append(n)

primeset = set(primes)
pfact = {}

def prime_fact(n):
	num = n
	fact = set()
	i = 0
	p = primes[i]
	while p <= n:
		if n in primeset:
			fact.add(n)
			break
		p = primes[i]
		if n%p == 0:
			fact.add(p)
			n /= p
			if n in pfact:
				fact |= set(pfact[n])
				break
		i += 1
	pfact[num] = tuple(fact)
	return fact

def phi(n):
	ph = n
	for p in prime_fact(n):
		ph *= (1 - (1/float(p)))
	return ph


total = 0
for d in range(2, bound+1):
	total += phi(d)
	
print int(total)
