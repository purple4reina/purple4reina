COMMENTS:

Before I started working on this problem, I wrote the following in my notes:

    I'm excited to work on this problem because I know I will learn something
    new about continued fractions and whatever these "stoneham numbers" are...

I definitely learned something about continued fractions.  At first I thought I
would have to find the exact period of each decimal expansion.  This lead me to
learning about Multiplicative Order.  I still don't totally grok what it is and
why it can be useful.  I hope that further problems use it more.

My final solution didn't end up using Multiplicative Order at all though.  It
was mostly by chance that I figured out that `n % t` gives the same value as `n
% (multiplicative order of t)`.


CODE:

def solve(n):
    t, total = 3, 0
    while t <= n:
        m, a = 1, 0
        mod = n % t - 1
        if mod > 0:
            m = pow(10, mod, t)
        for _ in range(15):
            d, m = divmod(m * 10, t)
            a = (a * 10 + d)
        total += a
        t *= 3
    return (total // 10**5) % 10**10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
