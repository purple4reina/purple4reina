CHAPTER 1:

This one was simple. I just made a python script to test each of the different rules.

def tests(n):
	number = [int(n) for n in str(n)]
	assert number[0] * number[1] == 24
	assert number[3] * 2 == number[1]
	assert (number[3] + number[4]) == (number[0] + number[2])
	assert sum(number) == 26
	assert number[1] > number[4]


for n in xrange(10000, 100000):
	try:
		tests(n)
		print n
	except:
		pass


CHAPTER 2:

A new file was added to my dropbox folder. This one said nothing of importance. But, when I check back at the 
password file, I saw there was a hint in there. Going to the list of employees, the clues directed me through 
them like a knight on the chess board.

I first thought I needed to create another file with the password in it. But instead, I needed to go to a the 
the webpage with the last word as the password.

For a while, the page kept giving me an error. My dropbox folder was working and working, but I didn't think 
much of it. I thought maybe there was just a huge backlog which, combined with my dying hard drive, made 
things go really slow. I walked away for a few hours.

When I got back, Chapter 2 was added to the captain's log, and Emily's instructions were added.


CHAPTER 3:

This one was similar to those before. Find the password, then put it in the box. The challenge was to find 
where all of these icons are found on the dropbox site. I had to create a new folder in order to find some of 
them.

Once the correct password was entered into the box, chapter 3 was added to my folder. And onto the next 
chapter!


CHAPTER 4:

This one again made a lot of sense pretty quickly. The link to google maps gave it away. I went through and 
found all of the places given and connected the dots to create letters.
